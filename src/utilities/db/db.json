            "name": "Arabian oryx",
            "Species": "Oryx leucoryx",
            "Description": "The Arabian oryx is amongst the largest desert mammals of the Arab region and throughout history has been an important aspect of its heritage. Once extinct in the wild, it once again inhabits the dry Arabian Peninsula. This species is a desert antelope that is highly adapted to its harsh desert environment. Its bright white coat serves to reflect the sun’s rays and its hooves are shovel-like and splayed, giving the animal a large surface area when it walks on the sandy ground. Both males and females have splendid straight, ringed horns as long as 68 centimeters (27 in) long; the female’s being thinner and longer than those of a male. These animals are famous for their stamina and beauty and have inspired many Arabian poets.",
            "Habitat": "Arabian oryx are a gregarious species and form herds of 5 to 30, with more if conditions are good. If conditions are poor, groups tend to consist of just a male with a couple of females, together with their young. Some males live a more solitary life and hold large territories. Within the herd, a dominance hierarchy is created by displays of posturing, which avoid serious injury from their long, sharp horns. These animals seem able to detect rainfall a great distance away and live an almost nomadic life, travelling vast areas searching for precious new growth after the intermittent rains. They are active mostly during early morning and in the late evening, resting in groups in the shade when the searing midday heat is present. Oryx dig depressions in the ground with their front hooves, so they can lie in cooler sand, which provides some protection against fierce desert winds.",
            "WhatItEats": "Arabian oryx are herbovires, they eat grasses and herbs, as well as roots and tubers. They can last without drinking water for a long time.",
            "ageRange": "20 Years",
            "Threats": "Humans use them for their meat and leather. Other parts have alleged medicinal uses. The head is also used as a trophy",

            "name": "Sumatran Elephant",
            "Species": "Elephas maximus sumatranus",
            "Description": "Sumatran elephants are the smallest Asian elephants, meanwhile differing from the other 2 sub-species morphologically, anatomically and genetically by brighter skin with less de-pigmented spots. Males of Sumatran elephant generally exhibit visible tusks, which don't tend to grow long. Tusks of female elephants are extremely short, usually being hidden under the upper lip. During the past 25 years, these endangered animals have lost about half of their overall population and are currently extinct from 69% of their original range as a result of deforestation.",
            "Habitat": "The Sumatran elephants are highly sociable animals, forming herds of 20 - 35 or 3 - 23 (according to another source) individuals, which are dominated by the largest adult female. When reaching the age of adolescence, males are either forced to leave the herd or do it by their own will, typically joining the herd only for mating. Meanwhile, females continue living with the herd, where they serve as 'nannies'. Old adult males are completely solitary due to being unable to travel with the herds. These elephants may be active at any time of the day, although the period of increased activity seems to occur from 2 hours before late afternoon till 2 hours before dawn, during which they look for food. When a group travels, its members constantly keep in touch in order to keep integrity of the herd. Typical forms of communication are soft vibrations of the upper trunk that are heard by conspecifics. According to a recent study, these animals are able to give out subsonic sounds, perceived at a distance of up to 5 km.",
            "WhatItEats": "Sumatran elephants are herbivores. The usual diet of these elephants consists of liana, bark, banana, young leaves as well as various types of wild herbs. When coming across paddy fields or farmlands, Sumatran elephants may also use paddy, sugar cane, young coconut leaves as well as different fruits such as papaya.",
            "ageRange": "60 to 70 years",
            "Threats": "As a result of the rapid development and deforestation in Sumatra, elephants often come into contact with human settlements. They raid crops, trample homes and sometimes even hurt or kill people. Those affected sometimes retaliate and poison or shoot elephants.",

Another difference between those two related species is the “finger”: Asian elephants have one “finger” on their upper lips while their African relatives possess two “fingers”, the second one on their lower lips. Skin color of Asian elephant varies from brown to gray. The elephant also has observable pink-colored spots on its ears, forehead, trunk and chest. Females of Asian elephant are identified by comparably smaller tusks.",
            "Habitat": "These elephants are very communicative mammals. As a general rule, they live in herds, consisting of more than 20 females. The oldest female leads the group in its movement routes, searching for food and water source. Sometimes herds can break up into smaller subgroups. Male elephants, on the contrary, lead solitary life. From time to time, though, they send and receive messages from the herds over huge distances by means of high frequencies sounds, imperceptible to the human ear. Asian elephants are not at all territorial. These animals are diurnal and crepuscular. They eat and walk at dusk and down while being absolutely passive the daytime heat. Reliable source of drinking water is a mandatory life condition for elephant, since they drink no less than once a day.",
            "WhatItEats": "Asian elephants are herbivores (folivores), feeding upon plants. Major components of their usual diet are grasses, leaves, roots, bark of trees and bushes.",

            "Threats": "These animals have been hunted and killed in large numbers, as a source of food, and then for ivory. Hunting for ivory continues to this day, being a notable threat to overall population of Asian elephant. Deforestation and agricultural activities are among threats, leading to constriction of the elephants’ habitat.",

            "Description": "White rhinos are the second largest land mammal and their name comes from the Afrikaan’s, a West Germanic language, word “weit” which means wide and refers to the animal’s mouth. Also known as the square-lipped rhinoceros, white rhinos have a square upper lip with almost no hair. Two genetically different subspecies exist, the nothnern and southern white rhino and are found in two different regions in Africa. ",
            "Habitat": "White rhinos probably the most sociable rhinoceroses, forming groups of up to 14 individuals, although group size is usually smaller. Each group occupies a territory of at least 75-8 sq. km. Their territories vary greatly, depending on type of habitat as well as availability of resources. White rhinos are sedentary creatures that rarely venture from their home range. Dominant males of this species lead solitary lives, fiercely defending their territories against intruding males. However, females and juveniles may freely roam through their home ranges. Territorial behavior is displayed by marking such as spreading dung, spraying urine, dragging their feet as well as damaging plants with their horns. White rhinos generally tolerate other species. Although they rarely fight, these mammals may occasionally engage serious in confrontations, which include displays such as slight horn butting and false charges. The daily procedures of these mammals include mud baths, which help them to cool off and get rid of parasites. Peak hours of their activity differs through seasons: during winter they are diurnal, in summer seasons they are crepuscular.",
            "WhatItEats": "The white rhino is herbivore (graminivore) mammal, maintaining a grass-based diet. The animal can survive 4 - 5 days without directly drinking water, although it will drink twice a day if possible.",
            "ageRange": "45 to 50 Years",
            "Threats": "The primary threat to this species has been international rhino horn trade, which led to high numbers of mortality among these animals. There are two main markets for rhinos: Asian market - primarily, China, Taiwan and South Korea, where these animals are used in traditional medicine; and Middle Eastern market, generally, Yemen and Oman, where their horns are highly valued and considered a prized material, from which locals make traditional \"jamiyas\" - ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers. And finally, White rhinos suffer from loss of their natural habitat as a result of development such as agriculture and human settlements.",

They have long, thick fur, of a brown or grey color. The dense fur contrasts with their faces, which have naked skin, as do their rump, which is red in adults. The male is larger than the female. Macaques have long whiskers and a beard, and their tail is short. As with other monkey species, the macaque has opposable thumbs, enabling it to take hold of things. It walks on its hind legs when holding something in its hands.",
            "Habitat": "Japanese macaques live in groups of 20-30, led by the dominant male. Females stay in their birth group for life, but males leave the group before sexual maturity. Females spend more of their time in trees, while males spend most of their time on the ground. The dominant male has a role in siring young, deciding where the troop should go, and protecting the troop from predators and other macaque troops. They are very sociable animals, especially the females who together groom and raise the troop's young.",
            "WhatItEats": "The Japanese macaque eats smaller animals and plants, mainly fruits, berries, seeds, flowers and young leaves, picking them from the surrounding vegetation. They also eat insects, crabs and bird's eggs during the winter months.",

During both seasons the underbelly is paler. The females have a face and throat that are paler than those of the males, particularly in summer. Adult red deer are hardly ever seen with spots, or, if so, there are not many of them. The distinguishing feature for stags are their antlers, which in mature adults are long and branched. The longer branches usually sweep backwards and have a number of much shorter ones in front.",
            "Habitat": "These deer are social animals, living in summer herds with up to 400 individuals. The herds are matriarchal, being dominated by a single female. Seasonal migrations occur, with deer moving to higher elevations for the summer, and to lower elevations over winter. In spring, the sexes separate after the mating season, females leaving to give birth, bulls forming separate summer herds. Bulls during the mating season are territorial, and otherwise are not aggressive towards other deer. Red deer browse early in the morning and late evening. During the day and late at night they are inactive, spending most of this time chewing their cud.",
            "WhatItEats": "Red deer are browsers, eating grasses, forbs and sedges in summer, and, in winter, woody growth (cedar, wintergreen, sumac, eastern hemlock, jack pine, staghorn, red maple and basswood). Deer particularly like dandelions, aster, hawkweed, clover, violets and sometimes mushroom.

Moreover, this animal is threatened with extinction as a result of continuous poaching and destruction of its forest habitat. These massive, giant bats belong to the group of megabats. There is very little information on the life expectancy of this species, although captive individuals are known to live as long as 23 years, while those in the wild are believed to live less - up to 15 years.",
            "Habitat": "The Giant golden-crowned flying fox is generally a nocturnal creature, foraging at night. This animal can fly a huge distance of up to 40 km per night when looking for food. During the season when fruits are available, these animals often gather in large colonies of up to 150,000 individuals, typically in areas with an abundance of fruits. Living in these large aggregations, individuals can warm up and escape predators. They not only form colonies of conspecifics, but also occur in mixed concentrations with the Malayan flying foxes. The Giant golden-crowned flying foxes rest in the characteristic upside down position. The well-developed eyesight helps them navigate environment as well as detect food, as opposed to other bats, which mainly rely on echolocation.",

Its head, neck and throat have black lines, and behind the ears they are black with a white spot in the center. The cat’s fur is relatively soft and thick, and, unusually, grows “in reverse” on the back of its neck, instead, slanting forwards. This animal has much individual variation in its beautiful coat pattern. Males and females are similar in size and appearance.",
            "Habitat": "The margay is a solitary and primarily nocturnal animal. In southern Brazil, however, it has been recorded as being active during the day as well. It is an agile and excellent climber and is able to descend head first from a tree or hang by one hind foot from a branch. It mainly rests and sleeps in trees, making its nests in hollows and is regarded as being more arboreal and better adapted to living in trees than other species of cat. Nevertheless, margays hunt and travel mostly while on the ground. Margays, like most cats, are territorial. Their home ranges to some extent may overlap, but individual animals keep their distance from one other. They mark their territory with urine, and secretions that come from scent glands between their toes and on their faces. Males have additional glands on their tails for this purpose.",
            "WhatItEats": "Margays eat a wide variety of prey, including both terrestrial and arboreal mammals, birds, birds’ eggs, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, and fruit.",
            "ageRange": "10 to 20 Years",
            "Threats": "Habitat destruction is the major threat to the margay, through deforestation, as much of the Amazon rainforest is being cleared for pasture, agriculture, and road building. The margay’s arboreal nature, and its naturally low reproductive output and low densities make it particularly vulnerable in the face of this threat. Over the next ten years, it is expected that populations of margay in the Amazon will become more isolated and fragmented. Illegal hunting in some areas is a continuing problem, and margays are also illegally captured for the pet trade.",

Groups or mobs of adults of both genders are often seen together, and both males and females groom each other. Once joeys reach their mother's pouches, the mob separates, with the males forming small \"bachelor groups\", while females and young form large groups. Antilopine kangaroos move both individually and in groups to and from grazing areas and return again to the same \"camp\". During the day they stay in shady wooded areas to keep out of the hot sun. They graze at dusk in grasslands and then at dawn return to the wooded areas. In the cooler wet season they sometimes graze during the day.",

            "Habitat": "Vaquitas can be found solitarily, in pairs as well as in groups, consisting up to 7 individuals. These shy and secretive animals do not tend to perform acrobatic maneuvers. When coming to the surface to breathe, they move slowly and are quite difficult to spot, barely disturbing the surface and diving back into the water. As common in cetaceans, these animals are known to use echolocation when looking for prey. However, some species of fish these cetaceans consume, give out specific sounds, suggesting that Vaquitas are likely to find them due to these sound instead of using echolocation. They also use echolocation when communication with conspecifics in areas with murky waters.",

The shell of the turtle has smooth, non-overlapping plates colored different shades of brown, with patterns that change as the turtle grows older. The underside of the shell is lighter colored. Green sea turtles are not able to pull their heads into their shells.",
            "Habitat": "Green Sea turtles spend their time alone and almost all their lives under water. They come out of the water only when nesting. Although they move quickly in the ocean, on land they are slow and also defenseless. Male green sea turtles hardly ever leave the water. Females leave the sea only to lay eggs and nest only at night. Green turtles swim underwater for approximately 4 to 5 minutes during routine activity, and come up to breathe at the surface for 1 to 3 seconds. They can sleep underwater for a few hours at a time but stay beneath the surface for a much shorter period when diving for food or escaping from predators. Although green sea turtles can’t pull their heads inside their shells, the adults have protection from predators due to their shells, their large size, and the thick scaly skin covering their heads and necks.",
            "WhatItEats": "Green sea turtles are mostly herbivorous. Most of their time is spent eating algae in the sea or the grass growing in shallow waters. Young turtles eat plants and organisms such as crabs, jellyfish, sponges, worms, and snails.",
            "ageRange": "100 Years",
            "Threats": "The main threats to these turtles include the degradation and loss of habitat, consumption of their eggs and meat, capture as bycatch, pollution and climate change. Beach armoring, building works, and sand extraction degrade the nesting habitat, while light pollution in the nesting areas fatally attracts hatchlings so that they do not head for the sea. Increased effluent, contamination from coastal development and over harvesting of algae all threaten the habitat of the green sea turtle.",

            "Description": "The Plains zebras are well-known African mammals, exhibiting characteristic black and white stripes all over their body. They are most abundant and, probably, most recognizable grazing animals of the continent. Their closest relatives are donkeys and horses. The sparkling coat of this species reflects more than 70% of incoming heat, which is likely to help these animals survive under scorching African sun. Each of these animals has its own unique stripe pattern, which helps identify individuals. Additionally, striped coat is used as ideal camouflage, allowing these ungulates remain unspotted by predators in the grass.",
            "Habitat": "The Plains zebras are highly gregarious animals, forming permanent family units. These are harem-based groups, consisting of a single dominant male called stallion as well as up to six females with their offspring. The core of each group is made up of females, which form rather close bonds. When the stallion leaves the group or is killed, the community members don't disperse. Instead, they wait until another alpha male takes over. When migrating, these ungulates can be observed in large concentrations, composed of several such harems. While in these large groups, harems rarely come into conflicts. Stallions usually display friendly attitude through ritual greetings, during which they raise their ears and sniff bodies of one another. On the other hand, females of different harems display noticeably aggressive behavior towards each other. Within a family unit, mutual grooming is a common activity, which is believed to enhance relationships between individuals. Grooming is generally performed between mothers and their young as well as siblings. In addition, the Plains zebras often display their status and settle conflicts through grooming.",
            "WhatItEats": "The Plains zebras are grazing and browsing mammals, known to maintain herbivorous diet, which is primarily composed of grasses and supplemented with herbs, leaves and twigs.",

Their naked head is red, as is their neck. Juveniles have buff feathers on their head and slightly darker plumage.",
            "Habitat": "Sarus cranes are regarded as the least social crane species. Especially when nesting, they can be very protective, and are aggressive towards intruders. They can therefore be considered a territorial species. Breeding pairs remain close by areas which have ample water supply. Pairs that are non-breeding flock together in bigger wetland areas. Although breeding pairs are territorial, sarus cranes form bigger flocks in the non-breeding season. The size of a flock usually depends on the wetland area. Within flocks, the cranes feed and roost. Sarus cranes are active during the day and sleep at night. They are known for dancing to attract mates. Characteristic loud trumpeting sounds may accompany these dances.",
            "WhatItEats": "Sarus cranes are omnivorous, and eat a wide range of food, such as aquatic plants like sedge tubers, seeds, rice and other grains, crustaceans, snails, large insects such as grasshoppers, amphibians, reptiles, small vertebrates and fish.",
            "ageRange": "30 to 40 Years",
            "Threats": "Sarus cranes are threatened mainly by loss of habitat throughout their range, due to drainage of wetlands, agricultural expansion and human development, which degrades their habitat. The use of pesticides, as well as collisions with wires, are important threats. These cranes are also commonly targeted by humans hunting and egg collecting.

All of these turtles, except very old ones, have serrations on the lateral and hind areas of their shells. Their heads are V-shaped, which gives them the look of birds’ beaks. There are 5 features that distinguish hawksbill sea turtles from other sea turtles. There are two sets of prefrontal scales on their heads, they have two claws on their forelimbs, their shells have thick, overlapping plates on the back, and four pairs underneath, and the shape of their mouths is different. Males have brighter pigmentation, a concave chest area, a thicker tail and long claws.",
            "Habitat": "Typically diurnal (except during the mating season), solitary hawksbills comb the continental shelves and reefs searching for food. They spend most of their life in the water foraging, resting and cleaning, and come ashore only for laying eggs. They mainly stay close by shorelines, where coral reefs with sponges are found, and not far from tropical beaches that are their nesting sites. Like other sea turtles, the hawksbill sea turtle makes incredible migrations when moving from feeding sites to areas where they nest.",
            "WhatItEats": "Hawksbill sea turtles feed mainly on sponges. Sea invertebrates, such as sea jellies are also common prey. They are omnivorous, eating mollusks, fish, crustaceans, marine algae, and other sea animals and plants. They like to feed in shallow shoals which have lots of brown algae.",
            "ageRange": "30 to 50 Years",
            "Threats": "A major threat to this animal is the illegal trade in much sought-after tortoiseshell, which has been used for centuries for jewelry and ornaments. There is also a large market for their meat and eggs, as well as stuffed young turtles as exotic gifts. They are also threatened by harvests for traditional customs, accidental tangling in fishing lines, the loss of nesting sites, and the degradation of coral reef systems, which are their feeding grounds. Climate change is a further threat. Ocean levels have risen and are predicted to rise even more in the future. This can lead to increased erosion of beaches and further degradation, which could wash nests away and decrease the nesting habitat.",

            "name": "Indian Elephant",
            "Species": "Elephas maximus indicus",
            "Description": "The Indian elephant is a nomadic animal, endemic to mainland Asia. It's one of the 3 subspecies of the Asian elephant. The animal is considerably smaller that African elephants. Indian elephants travel constantly, staying in one place for less than a few days. The highest point of their body is on their head. Females of the Indian elephant lack tusks. In addition, females are distinguished by a finger-like process on the tip of their trunk.",
            "Habitat": "Indian elephants are both diurnal and nocturnal. They are highly social animals, gathering into matriarchal units: these are stable groups, which may consist of more than 20 related females. The leader of a group is the oldest female. She guides the herd in their search of food and water sources. These matriarchal units can occasionally divide into smaller, temporary groups. These small herds communicate with each other by low frequency vocalizations, heard from afar. Some males are known to join these groups. These elephants are non-territorial animals. The Indian elephants used to migrate seasonally. However, they presently cannot do it due to agricultural development and other human activities. Along with many other large mammals, these animals handle cold better than heat. During the hottest part of the day, elephants usually shelter, releasing heat through their ear by flapping them at different speed, depending on the extent of heat.",
            "WhatItEats": "As megaherbivorous animals, Indian elephants primarily feed upon grasses, supplementing their diet with bark, roots, leaves, stems of trees, vines, shrubs as well as bananas, rice, sugarcane and other cultivated crops.",
            "ageRange": "70 Years",
            "Threats": "Currently, Indian elephants greatly suffer from habitat loss and fragmentation due to illegal encroachment into protected areas as well as forest clearing for road development. Furthermore, loss of habitat reduces the amount of suitable food and leaves the elephants without shelter, leading to fragmentation of their range. Hence, isolated populations are formed on scattered remains of their former range. As a result, these animals can neither migrate nor mix with other herds of conspecifics. Thus, Indian elephants look for new sources of food, taking destructive raids to farms, settlements and plantations, located within their original range. These confrontations with humans cause high number of mortality, sharply decreasing the population of these animals in the wild. On the other hand, males of this species attract poachers for their ivory tusks, which are presently in high demand among Asian middle class, regardless the global ban on ivory trade.",

Its facial color ranges from red to pink to black. Their long arms are useful for reaching fruits and swinging from branch to branch. Their hands and feet are scoop-like and have a powerful grip for grasping branches. Adult males occur in two forms, which are flanged or unflanged. The flanged males are larger and on both sides of their face they have fleshy ‘flanges’, or cheek pads.",
            "Habitat": "Bornean orangutans rarely come down to the ground out of the trees where they live. They spend most of the daylight hours sitting in the canopy and eating, before building a nest to sleep in at night, by folding leafy branches. Small groups of females sometimes travel with their babies when seeking food, but adult males usually are solitary, though they may have occasional social connections. 6 or more in a group of Bornean orangutans is rare but this is found at times of mass fruiting, when groups of trees suddenly fruit all at the same time. Seasonal and daily movements change often and are influenced by how available the fruit is. Bornean orangutans use a number of different methods to move from one place to another. Brachiation (arm swinging) is seen only in young orangutans, older orangutans walking on all fours, or occasionally on two limbs.",
            "WhatItEats": "Bornean orangutans are frugivorous, eating forest fruits, shoots, leaves, insects, sap, vines, birds’ eggs, spiders’ webs, fungi, flowers, bark, and sometimes nutrient rich soils.",
            "ageRange": "45 to 60 Years",
            "Threats": "The major threat to Bornean orangutan is habitat loss due to deforestation and wild fire.

The hair on the underbelly and face is whitish to pale-brown. The skin of the Sunda pangolins' feet is granular and there are pads on the front feet. These animals have thick and powerful claws to dig into the soils in search of ant nests or to tear into termite mounds. Sunda pangolins have poor eyesight, but a highly developed sense of smell. Lacking teeth, their long, sticky tongue serves to collect ants and termites. Males in this species are larger than females.",
            "Habitat": "Sunda pangolins are generally solitary but sometimes can be found in pairs. A large part of their life is spent in trees. They are nocturnal and behave timidly. They are strong diggers and make burrows lined with vegetation for insulation near termite mounds and ant nests. Sunda pangolins usually move slowly on all four feet unless threatened. When feeling danger these animals can move swiftly using only hindfeet and helping with their prehensile tail. When threatened, they also protect their soft underparts by rolling into balls. Sunda pangolins are also good swimmers.",

The adult male's winter plumage is similar to the female's, but the wings and tail remain darker.",
            "Habitat": "Scarlet tanagers are social birds and outside of the breeding season they often join mixed foraging flocks. They are active during the day but often stay out of sight, foraging high in trees; they will sometimes fly out to catch insects in flight and then return to the same general perch, in a hunting style known as \"sallying\". This is a feeding strategy in which birds catch flying insects in the air. Sometimes, however, they also capture their prey on the forest floor. Scarlet tanagers migrate around April; they begin arriving in the breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in midsummer; by early October, they are all on their way south.

            "name": "Indian Star Tortoise",
            "Species": "Geochelone elegans",
            "Description": "The Indian star tortoise is of medium size for a tortoise and is found in the arid and dry forests in India and Sri Lanka. Its name comes from the star-like patterns that feature on its high-domed shell. Because of these very distinctive patterns and its highly rounded shell, the Indian star tortoise is popular in the world's trade in exotic pets. The attractive markings on its shell, aside from looking very pretty, serve to help this tortoise more easily blend in with its surroundings, by breaking up the hard edge of the shell, so when the tortoise is grazing, it is not so obvious to predators passing by.",
            "Habitat": "Indian star tortoises are generally crepuscular, which means they are active in the early morning and the late afternoon during dry, hot weather. The rest of the time, they shelter under vegetation or some other cover. In the rainy season, they are much more active, moving around and feeding for much of the day. They become inactive in western India and Pakistan during the colder months of winter. These solitary animals do not hibernate, but when it is very dry and hot, or very cold, they stay inactive. Perception and communication appears to be mostly visual, though tactile and olfactory senses are also used during feeding, courtship, male competitive behavior, and nesting, and a male tortoise will vocalize to a female during mating.",
            "WhatItEats": "Indian star tortoises are mainly herbivores (folivores and frugivores) and mostly eat grasses, herbaceous leaves, flowers, and fruit, and sometimes insects, carrion, and dung.",
            "ageRange": "25 to 80 Years",
            "Threats": "Natural threats to this species are predation and flooding, but humans have drastically reduced their numbers through loss of habitat and collection for food and for the exotic pet trade. In much of India, Indian star tortoises are important as a food source. They are also an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, and they are susceptible to disease, particularly pneumonia, respiratory diseases, and overgrowth of parasites when stressed by handling, collection and shipment, often under inhumane conditions. Many specimens caught to be sold as pets will die from unsuspected disease.",

            "Description": "The Sun bear is the smallest and one of the rarest bear species. It is also known as the \"honey bear\", for its love of honeycombs and honey. Sun bears have jet-black, short, and sleek fur with some under-wool; some individuals are reddish or gray in color. Two whirls occur on the shoulders, from where the hair radiates in all directions. A crest is seen on the sides of the neck and a whorl occurs in the center of the breast patch. Always, a more or less crescent-shaped pale patch is found in the breast that varies individually in color ranging from buff, cream, or dirty white to ochreous. The legend says that Sun bears were named after this patch on their chest because it represents the rising sun.",
            "Habitat": "Sun bears are solitary animals that are active both during the day and night. As they occur in tropical regions with year-round available foods, they do not hibernate. Sun bears are excellent and agile climbers. They sleep in fallen hollow logs, in standing trees with cavities, in cavities underneath fallen logs or tree roots, and in tree branches high above the ground. Sun bears are known as very fierce animals when surprised in the forest.",
            "WhatItEats": "Sun bears are omnivores and bees, beehives, and honey are their important food items. They also feed primarily on termites, ants, beetle larvae, bee larvae and a large variety of fruit species, especially figs when available. During feeding, the Sun bear can extend its exceptionally long tongue 20-25 cm (7.9-9.8 in) to extract insects and honey.",
            "ageRange": "30 Years",
            "Threats": "The two major threats to Sun bears are habitat loss and commercial hunting. These threats are not evenly distributed throughout their range. In areas where deforestation is actively occurring, they are mainly threatened by the loss of forest habitat and forest degradation arising from clear-cutting for plantation development, unsustainable logging practices, illegal logging both within and outside protected areas, and forest fires. The main predator of Sun bears throughout their range by far is a man. Commercial poaching of bears for the wildlife trade is a considerable threat in most countries. Sun bears are among the three primary bear species specifically targeted for the bear bile ( a digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, which is used by some in traditional Chinese medicine) trade in Southeast Asia, and are kept in bear farms in Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar.",

            "Description": "The Tufted gray langur is an Old World monkey, one of the species of langurs. There are two subspecies of Tufted gray langurs. One of which occurs in India, and another one in Sri Lanka. In Sri Lankan subspecies, the dorsal area gray to brownish gray in color, getting darker with the age. Underparts are light grayish. They also have short whitish beard and sideburns. The hairs of the crown form a distinct pointed tuft or crest, that meets at a central point, hence the name of this species. Male Tufted gray langurs are larger than females.",
            "Habitat": "Tufted gray langurs are generally shy animals. They are partially arboreal, semi-terrestrial and diurnal in habit. They often come to the ground when there is no danger. Tufted gray langurs live in troops that may include 20-50 individuals. Large troops are led by both large male-female combinations, whereas small troops are governed by an alpha male. Sub adult males and other males usually spend the time with searching for foods, rivals with neighboring alpha males, and protecting the troop. Females spend the time with feeding the young, grooming them, and playing. Tufted gray langurs communicate with the help of barks, grunts, whoops, whistles and howls. The cough like voice is used for giving tension, and whistling for the contact loss with the troop. The superior eyesight of these animals and ability to sit atop high trees allows them to spot predators easily. Researchers have noted that this species will often sit next to herds of the Spotted deer and notify them when a predator is approaching. Additionally, these langurs will often drop fruit from tall trees, which Spotted deer will then feed on. In return, the Spotted deer’s excellent sense of smell allows it to detect predators early on and warn the langur that something may be approaching.",
            "WhatItEats": "Tufted gray langurs are herbivores (folivores, frugivores). They are fond of eating anything vegetarian. They mainly feed on leaves and also eat fruits and seeds.",
            "ageRange": "Females live over 30 years while male only live for 18 years",

Although rare in its native country of North Africa, it was introduced to both North America and southern Europe, as well as other places. Aoudad is another name for this animal, a name used by the Berbers, who are natives of North Africa. Males and females both have horns, with those of the male being much longer, thicker, and more heavily ridged compared to the female’s more slender horns. Males are also much heavier, and their curtain of hair is heavier, almost touching the ground. Their short tail, hairless on its underside, has scent glands.",
            "Habitat": "These animals live in small groups, usually with one dominant male and a number of females. Males compete for breeding dominance, though males of different ages can live quite well together. An adult male must earn his position heading a group of females by means of intimidation displays, by showing the magnificent mane of hair, and fierce fights where two males stand as far as 15 meters apart, then walk quickly toward each other, lowering their heads and breaking into a run to collide with each other. Living in desert areas, these sheep are usually most active during dawn and dusk, attempting to remain in the shade or shelter during the day when it is hot. When threatened, they usually do not run from a predator but stand extremely still so that they blend in with the surroundings.",
            "WhatItEats": "This species is herbivorous (folivorous), eating a range of vegetation such as shrubs, grass, and forbs. In the winter, they mostly eat grass, shrubs being more common for the rest of the year.",
            "ageRange": "10 to 20 Years",
            "Threats": "The major threats across the range to Barbary sheep include habitat destruction and poaching, mainly from livestock grazing, collection of wood for fuel, and from desertification and drought. In the Western Sahara, soldiers hunting these animals have been a major threat, and the Barbary sheep might already be extinct in this region. The decline of this species has no doubt been increased by competition with feral camels and livestock.",

These birds have bare facial patch obscured by blue feather-lines merging into blue lower cheek and throat, separated from the crown by narrow yellow stripe and bare pink skin around the base of the large, black bill. Despite being plentiful in captivity, these beautiful and intelligent birds are critically endangered in the wild and are protected by trading prohibitions.",
            "Habitat": "Blue-throated macaws are social birds; they are most frequently seen in pairs, but also gather in small groups of 7 to 9 individuals and sometimes may roost in groups of 70. Their main mode of locomotion is flying, but they are also able to climb trees, maneuver along branches and walk on the ground. These birds are active during the day and usually, stay in one general area. Blue-throated macaws communicate mostly by sound. When they suspect danger, they emit a very loud alarming call and promptly fly off. These birds also communicate with each other with quiet caws.",

They are brown in color with golden to reddish-brown areas on their chest and shoulders. The head of these bats is yellowish in color, and the wings are slate-grey to black in color. Both sexes look alike, but males are slightly bigger in size than females.",
            "Habitat": "Madagascan flying foxes are nocturnal creatures. During the day they roost in large trees in colonies of up to 1000 individuals although 400 is more common. These bats are noisy and easily disturbed, and if roused, the whole colony may move off to an alternative roost site. Most roosts are located in isolated trees in degraded areas. Madagascan flying foxes are territorial only during the breeding season when dominant males establish territories on the roost tree which they guard against other males. Females roost within these male territories. Outside the breeding season, territories are usually not maintained, however, bats try to roost in the same place. Dominant males also establish feeding territories on preferable feeding trees and can travel up to 50 km from the roost site to get food. In order to communicate with each Madagascan flying foxes use scent and sound to distinguish other roost members or produce squawks, male whinny/female whinny, chatters, and honks. Males also mark their territories with scents and use scent cues in females during the breeding season.",
            "WhatItEats": "Madagascan flying foxes are mainly frugivorous animals. Their diet consists of fruit juice which is squeezed from the fruit in the mouth. They also feed on leaves, figs, flowers, and nectar.",

The two differ in appearance and behavior, with Sumatran orangutans being slightly smaller and usually having hair that is lighter colored and orange-red, as well as a longer beard. Males develop throat pouches and fleshy pads on their cheeks but these are narrower and less pronounced than those of male Bornean orangutans.",
            "Habitat": "Sumatran orangutans lead very solitary lives, during the day moving slowly in search of food through the trees. Up to 60% of an orangutan’s time is spent foraging and eating, and, although they can occupy large home ranges, half a mile a day is the most they usually travel. At night, they build a nest for sleeping up high in the canopy out of folded branches. They are not very territorial, sharing their home ranges with others, sometimes feeding alongside other orangutans around especially abundant fruit trees. Males will stake their claim to their territory by emitting long-calls, deep calls from their throat poach which echo through the forest to attract females and also to warn off potential rivals.",
            "WhatItEats": "The diet of Sumatran orangutans varies seasonally, depending on the fruiting season of trees in the local area, the animals feeding when the fruit is ripe. Figs are very important in their diet. When fruit is not so available in dry seasons, Sumatran orangutans will eat vegetation such as young leaves, bark and flowers, and insects, particularly termites, ants, and crickets, and sometimes eggs.",
            "ageRange": "35 to 50 Years",

Both male and female Mountain goats have beards, short tails, and long black horns that contain yearly growth rings. They are protected from the elements by their woolly white double coats. The fine, dense wool of their undercoats is covered by an outer layer of longer, hollow hairs. Their coats help Mountain goats to withstand winter temperatures as low as -46 °C (-51 °F) and winds of up to 160 kilometers per hour (99 mph).",
            "Habitat": "Mountain goats are social animals; after the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult males (billies) breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Females (nannies) form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals. They are active during the day and spend most of their time grazing. Mountain goats establish dominance hierarchies and can be quite aggressive. Nannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources. They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd. In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns. As with fights between billies during the breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death but are usually harmless. To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground. In regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators such as mountain lions, wolves, wolverines, lynxes, and bears.",
            "WhatItEats": "Mountain goats are herbivores (graminivores, folivores). Their diets include grasses, herbs, sedges, ferns, mosses, lichens, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat.",

It has a distinctive appearance, having a large crest and one of the biggest beaks of any parrot, a beak unusual in itself, as the upper and lower mandibles do not meet along much of the length, which allows the bird’s tongue to hold a nut in place against its top mandible while its lower mandible does the work to open it. Between the eyes and the beak there is a patch of bare skin, red in color. There is also a distinctive red patch on the cheek that changes color if the bird is excited or alarmed. In young birds, their underfeathers are lined with pale yellow and in birds under the age of 18 months, the tip of the beak and the ring around the eye are white.",
            "Habitat": "Palm cockatoos are found alone, in pairs, or in larger groups. Sometimes they stay quite close by their nesting sites, but they can travel a long way to search for food or water. A few trees for nesting sites are included within their territory.

It has the long, pointed nose characteristic of all river dolphins. Its teeth are visible in both the upper and lower jaws even when the mouth is closed. The teeth of young animals are almost an inch long, thin, and curved; however, as animals age, the teeth undergo considerable changes, and in mature adults become square, bony, flat disks. The body is brownish in color and stocky in the middle. In the place of a dorsal fin, South Asian dolphins have only a small, triangular lump.",
            "Habitat": "South Asian dolphins are not gregarious and prefer to spend time singly. However, they may occasionally gather in small groups of up to 30 individuals where the best fishing spots are. South Asian river dolphins have poor eyesight and rely on echolocation to find prey. Their extended rostrum is advantageous in detecting hidden or hard-to-find prey items. The prey is held in their jaws and swallowed. Their teeth are used as a clamp rather than a chewing mechanism. During the monsoon, South Asian river dolphins tend to migrate to tributaries of the main river systems. Some individuals may swim along with their beaks emerging from the water, and they may \"breach\"; jumping partly or completely clear of the water and landing on their sides. South Asian river dolphins are highly vocal and most typically communicate with the help of echolocation sounds such as clicks, bursts, and twitters.",

            "Threats": "The most serious threat to South Asian river dolphins comes from human activities. These animals have been adversely affected by human use of river systems in South Asia. Entanglement in fishing nets as bycatch can cause significant damage to local populations, and individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat are used as a liniment, as an aphrodisiac, and as bait for catfish. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also been a contributing factor towards population decline, as these chemicals are biomagnified in the bodies of the dolphins. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which dolphins can breed. An immediate danger for the populations in National Chambal Sanctuary is the decrease in river depth and appearance of sand bars dividing the river course into smaller segments, as irrigation has lowered water levels throughout their range.",

            "Species": "Priodontes maximus",
            "Description": "The Giant armadillo is one of the largest species of armadillos. This animal is easily recognizable due to its powerful, enlarged central claw and the carapace, covered with tough bony scales. Pentagonal scales cover the legs and tail of the animal. The carapace of the Giant armadillo is black or gray on the dorsal part and lighter - on the ventral part of its body, these two parts being separated by a strip. The body underneath the carapace is naked, wrinkly and pinkish in color. The Giant armadillo has conical head and blunt muzzle.",
            "Habitat": "Giant armadillos live in a variety of habitats, preferring, however, areas with a large population of termites. They can occasionally be seen in arid and semi-arid woodlands, savannas, tropical and subtropical rainforests as well as Brazilian floodplains.",
            "WhatItEats": "Giant armadillos are carnivores (insectivores).Their usual diet primarily consists of termites, though they can also consume ants, spiders, larvae and worms.",
            "ageRange": "12-15 years",
            "Threats": "Giant armadillo attracts hunters for its meat and primarily – for subsistence. The animal is threatened by loss of habitat due to deforestation. Being considered as a pest, this animal is frequently killed by farmers throughout the area of its habitat. And finally, the species is threatened by illegal trade, being captured and sold to wealthy animal collectors.",

            "Description": "The aardwolf is an insectivorous mammal, native to Africa. It belongs to the same family as the hyena, however, unlike many of its carnivorous relatives, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals. It eats insects and their larvae.",
            "Habitat": "Aardwolves are shy and nocturnal animals that sleep in burrows by day. During the winter, however, they may, on occasion, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens. They live in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their young. If their territory is infringed upon, aardwolves will chase the intruder up to 400 m (1,300 ft) or to the border. If the intruder is caught, which rarely happens, a fight will occur, which is accompanied by soft clucking, hoarse barking, and a type of roar. The majority of incursions occur during the mating season. When food is scarce, the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a \"single territory\". Their dens are usually abandoned aardvark, springhare, or porcupine dens, or on occasion, they find shelter in crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares. They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day. Aardwolves locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. They feed primarily on termites licking them off the ground. Aardwolves do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months.",
            "WhatItEats": "Aardwolves are carnivores (insectivores). They feed mainly on termites but also other insects, larvae, eggs, and, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.",
            "ageRange": "8 to 12 Years",
            "Threats": "Aardwolves are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. In some areas, they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental. In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but aardwolves are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Aardwolves are also killed by dogs and other carnivores and suffer from incidents on roads.",

            "Description": "The Baiji is a possibly extinct species of freshwater dolphin and is thought to be the first dolphin species driven to extinction due to the impact of humans. The Baiji is pale blue to gray on the dorsal (back) side, and white on the ventral (belly) side. It has a long and slightly-upturned beak with 31-36 conical teeth on either jaw. Its dorsal fin is low and triangular in shape and resembles a light-colored flag when the dolphin swims just below the surface of the murky Yangtze River, hence the name \"white-flag\" dolphin.",
            "Habitat": "Baiji are diurnal and social animals. They occur in pairs or small groups of about 10 individuals spending the day in search of fish. They are usually quiet and shy and difficult to approach. When escaping from danger, these dolphins can reach 60 km/h (37 mph), but usually stay within 30 to 40 km/h (19 to 25 mph). Because of the poor vision, baiji rely primarily on sonar for navigation. The sonar system also plays an important role in socializing, predator avoidance, group coordination, and expressing emotions.",
            "WhatItEats": "Baiji are carnivores (piscivores) and feed on a wide variety of freshwater fish.",
            "ageRange": "24 Years",
            "Threats": "The baiji population declined drastically in decades as China industrialized and made heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation, and hydroelectricity. It has been credibly claimed, after surveys in the Yangtze River during the 1980s, that baiji could be the first dolphin species in history that humans have driven to extinction. The main threats to the species included a period of hunting by humans during the Great Leap Forward, entanglement in fishing gear, the illegal practice of electric fishing, collisions with boats and ships, habitat loss, and pollution. Further studies have noted that a lack of information on the baiji's historical distribution or ecology, the environmental impact of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the living space of the baiji, and the failure to act for the protection of the baiji are also threats to the species. In August 2007, a Chinese man reportedly videotaped a large white animal swimming in the Yangtze. Although the animal was tentatively identified as a baiji, the presence of only one or a few animals, particularly of advanced age, is not enough to save a functionally extinct species from true extinction. The World Wildlife Fund is calling for the preservation of any possible baiji habitat, in case the species is located and can be revived.",

            "Description": "The European rabbit is a small mammal native to southwestern Europe and to northwest Africa. It is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. European rabbits are generally greyish-brown in color. The patch on their chest is brown, while the rest of the underparts are white or grey. A white star shape is often present on kits' foreheads but rarely occurs in adults. The whiskers are long and black, and the feet are fully furred and buff-colored. The tail has a white underside, which becomes prominent when escaping danger. This may act as a signal for other rabbits to run.",
            "Habitat": "European rabbits are well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where they spend most of their time when not feeding. These are gregarious animals, which live in stable social groups centered around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. Within these groups, there are dominance hierarchies for both bucks (males) and does (females). Warrens usually contain 2-10 individuals living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success. Does tend to be more territorial than bucks, although the areas most frequented by does are not defended. Territories are marked with dung hills. European rabbits are active from late afternoon to early morning and usually stay above the ground during the night. They rarely stray far from their burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, they typically only move 25 meters away from the burrow, and rarely 50 meters. European rabbits are usually silent animals, though they have at least two vocalizations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal. This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap. During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill hiccups and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl.",
            "WhatItEats": "European rabbits are herbivores (graminivores, folivores). They eat a wide variety of herbage, especially grasses, favoring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species. Hungry rabbits in winter may eat tree bark and blackberries.",
            "ageRange": "9 Years",
            "Threats": "The main threats to European rabbits include habitat loss and fragmentation, and diseases. These animals also suffer from hunting and trapping; they are known as an invasive species because they have been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and have caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. For instance, feral European rabbits in Australia have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.",

Males are more robust than females and have horns. Kobs are typically golden to reddish-brown in color. Their throat patch, eye ring, and inner ear are white, and the forelegs are black at the front. Males get darker as they get older.",
            "Habitat": "Kobs are diurnal animals, but inactive during the heat of the day. They live in groups of either females and calves or just males. These groups generally range from 5 to 40 animals. Females may also live in herds numbering in the thousands. They move more and are more social than territorial males. During the daily movements to water, females are at the front and young learn where to go from their mothers. Males are also present in the migratory herds and follow the females. All-male herds may number in the hundreds and accompany females as they travel during the dry season. Adult males try to establish their territories in the best habitat available, which are inhabited by herds of females and their young. Young males, live in bachelor herds and are segregated from the females by the territorial males. On floodplains, males establish traditional territories, while the rest live in clustered territories known as leks. Lek clusters are located on patches of short grass or bare ground within comparably tall grassland.",

It looks somewhat like a huge prehistoric turkey on stilts, wearing a large pointed casque or helmet. It is the second biggest bird on Earth alive today. Its name is from a Papuan word meaning ‘horned head’, a reference to the helmet made of tough skin on the top of its head. This casque slopes backwards and the bird uses it to push through vegetation when running through the rainforest, head down. Its 'helmet' also reflects dominance and age. Male and female look like each other, although females are usually larger and heavier. The chicks are striped cream and black, fading to brown after about five months. Adult colors and the casque start to develop around two to four years of age",
            "Habitat": "Cassowaries require a high diversity of fruiting trees to provide a year-round supply of fleshy fruits. Although occurring primarily in rainforest, they also use woodlands, melaleuca swamps, mangroves and even beaches, both as intermittent food sources and as connecting habitat between more suitable sites. Places with a mix of these environments are preferred by cassowaries that live near the coast.",

The forest is cleared for agriculture and development, causing populations become isolated and fragmented, reducing genetic variation. These birds also may not have access in their forest patches to sufficient food or water. Traffic accidents also kill many of these birds, particularly in Queensland, where more humans are coming to live. Humans also bring dogs, which prey particularly on the young birds.

These bats are named for erectable epaulettes of hair that form around large scent glands in males only Males are also distinguished from females by air sacs on the neck that may increase the volume of courtship calls. Scent glands are located near the white ear patches in both sexes. Their wings are very broad compared to other bat species.",

They roost in groups in well-lit open trees, under palm fronds, in dense forests near rivers, under thatched roofs of sheds, and, rarely, in caves. These roosting groups may be 3-100 individuals. Bats typically change roost locations daily or every few days and may fly as far as 4 km (2.5 mi) to feeding areas. Frequent change of roosting sites depends on the ripening of fruit trees and also may be a strategy to decrease predation. Females travel greater distances to feeding areas early in the night while males travel farther closer to dawn. While roosting, bats are usually quiet and do not intrude on each other's space. They like to groom themselves and this may last up to 30 minutes; after that, they usually take off from the roost tree. Most flight occurs in the first three hours of the night. The flight of Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat is relatively slow and somewhat clumsy, and they often bump into other individuals and obstacles.",

They have white markings that start below the snout and run to the cheek area just below the eyes. Young peccaries are grey, reddish or dark in color, sometimes with a white throat.",
            "Habitat": "White-lipped peccaries are active during the day, more specifically in the mornings and afternoons. They live in herds that number 20-300 individuals, including both males and females, and cases have been reported of herds reaching 2000 peccaries. These animals can spend up to two-thirds of their day traveling and feeding. They also like to wallow in mud. Often, peccaries can be smelled before seen because they give off a skunk-like odor. When these animals roam in their range land, they can be very loud, clattering their teeth and grunting to one another to communicate and stay within the herd. They communicate with olfactory, acoustic, and physical contact to keep together in the herd. When cornered or feel threatened White-lipped peccaries become aggressive; they give off a loud “bark” and show off their teeth in an attempt to avoid conflict.",

            "Habitat": "Azara's agoutis are active during the day. It's quite difficult to study these animals as they are naturally extremely shy and will flee and hide when humans approach. Their shyness is thought to be related to their solitary lifestyles and maybe because they are heavily preyed upon by many carnivorous species, including humans. However, if bred in captivity, they can become trusting animals. When threatened Azara's agoutis will let out little barks. These animals are sometimes known as \"jungle gardeners\", as they often bury nuts and seeds and forget where they put them, therefore helping new plants to grow.

These marmosets have black and grey fur on their body, blackish and pale fur on their tails and yellowish underparts. They have orange to yellow fur on their crown and cheeks. Like all marmosets, they have claws instead of nails on all digits except the big toes. This adaptation allows marmosets to cling to trees with ease while feeding on their favorite food, tree gum.",
            "Habitat": "Buffy-headed marmosets are social arboreal animals. They live in groups of up to fifteen consisting of related individuals, where females dominate males. Each group usually contains only one breeding female. Buffy-headed marmosets are active during the day. Due to their small size, these marmosets have many predators and have developed four distinct patterns of predator avoidance. Primarily, they avoid aerial predators through low-intensity alarm signals, emitting soft, closed-mouth whistles to warn other group members. Another behavior in dealing with aerial threats is a high-intensity alarm. They will produce a half-mouthed, open whistle to alert other members to take cover under branches or trees, sometimes immediately ceasing movement to avoid exposure. The third type of anti-predator alarm is for low-intensity terrestrial threats. A few marmosets in the group will give a call to the rest, alerting them of a possible threat such as a snake. Marmosets then “mob” the predator by amassing in large groups, thus not giving the predator a chace to attack. The last reaction is for high-intensity terrestrial situations. In instances of dealing with larger or more threatening predators, such as the tayra, marmosets amass in a large group, yelping in piercingly loud manner to try and scare the predator away.",
            "WhatItEats": "Buffy-headed marmosets are herbivores. They primarily eat fruits, gum, and plant exudates. They may also consume bird eggs and nestlings.

These animals shed their fur twice per year, bearing a reddish-brown coat in the summer and grayish-brown coat in winter.",
            "Habitat": "Northern pikas are crepuscular and social. They live in a network of burrows which they make themselves and also use crevices in the rocks or subterranean runways. Each underground network has many entrances and pathways that are connescted with feeding areas on the surface. When above ground, these small animals spend their time moving about, feeding, grooming or sitting in a stationary position. They mostly move around using short jumps but can also walk, run, and climb. During foraging, they gather food and carry it back to one of the eating points near entrances to the burrow. If alarmed while feeding, the pika may dash to its hole or remain stationary and alert till the danger passes. They also collect green parts of plants, allow them to dry, and store them in caches. Northern pikas do not hibernate and can tunnel under the snow to reach their caches or visit areas where twigs and other plants are still available. When threatened these animals produce a sharp warning cry \"Kitz\" or may call to other pikas in the area and those may respond. Other shrill calls may be made when sitting or moving around.",

This unusual antelope has a distinctive pair of closely spaced, bloated nostrils directed downward. The coat of these animals changes according to the season. In summer, it appears yellow to red, fading toward the flanks. In winter, the coat develops a pale, grayish-brown color, with a hint of brown on the belly and the neck. The ventral parts are generally white. Only males possess horns that are thick and slightly translucent. The horns are wax-colored and show 12 to 20 pronounced rings.",
            "Habitat": "antelopes live in semideserts, grasslands, open woodlands, and steppes. They avoid travelling through heavily forested areas, preferring to stay out in the open where they can spot predators and run unimpeded. Saigas will also avoid areas that are extremely rocky or steep terrain for the same reason.",

            "ageRange": "10-12 years",
            "Threats": "The population of Saiga antelope fell drastically following the collapse of the USSR due to uncontrolled hunting and demand for horns in Chinese medicine. Saigas have been a target of hunting since prehistoric ages when hunting was an essential means to acquire food. The horns, meat, and skin of these animals have commercial value and are exported from Kazakhstan. Saiga horn, known as Cornu Antelopis, is one of the main ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine that is used as an extract or powder additive to the elixirs, ointments, and drinks. Their value is equal to the rhinoceros horn, whose trade was banned in 1993. Although hunting and trade are considered illegal, the horn products still can be found sold publicly and openly in a great variety of venues and businesses. Another serious threat to Saiga antelopes is habitat loss. Agricultural advancement and human settlements have been shrinking habitat areas of these animals since the 20th century. Occupants limited Saiga's passage to water resources and the winter and summer habitats. Saigas are also dependent on weather and affected by climate fluctuations to a great extent due to their migratory nature. Harsh winters with strong winds or high snow coverage disable feeding on the grass under the thick snow. Population size usually dramatically decreases after severe cold months. Moreover, high temperatures in the steppe region lead to springtime floods, in which saiga calves can drown.",

            "Description": "The endangered Black-footed ferret belongs to the weasel family and is the only ferret that is native to North America. Domestic ferrets are a different species and of European origin. The Black-footed ferret was once found in the tens of thousands, however, by the 1960s they were almost extinct. Although still endangered, the species is on its way to making a comeback. Concerted efforts over the last thirty years from many federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, private landowners, zoos, and conservation organizations have assisted in the survival of Black-footed ferrets.",
            "Habitat": "live and hunt in grasslands, specifically prairies. These ferrets inhabit abandoned prairie dog dens, and live only where prairie dog populations still exist.",
            "WhatItEats": "Black-footed ferrets are carnivores, they mostly eat prairie dogs, also sometimes mice, ground squirrels, or other small animals.",
            "ageRange": "38-41 years",
            "Threats": "The Black-footed ferret population fell drastically in the earlier half of the 20th century, mainly due to habitat loss. Currently, habitat loss and introduced disease are key threats to this species. The ferrets are entirely dependent on prairie colonies for shelter, food, and raising young. Without sufficient reintroduction sites and protection against plague, recovery for this species remains difficult.",

            "Description": "Pampas deer belong to the New World deer family; it is another term for all South American deer species. Pampas deer have tan fur, lighter on their undersides and insides of legs. Their coats do not change with the seasons. They have white spots above their lips and white patches on their throats. Their tails are short and bushy, and when they run, they lift their tail to reveal a white patch. Males have small, lightweight antlers that are 3-pronged; they shed them in August or September, with a newly grown set by December. Females have hair whorls that look like tiny antlers stubs.",
            "Habitat": "Pampas deer are social animals that live in groups. These groups are not separated by gender, and bucks (males) will drift between groups. There are usually only 2-6 deer in a group, but there can be many more in good feeding areas. They do not have monogamous pairs, nor are there harems. Pampas deer do not defend territory or mates but do have displays of dominance. They show dominance by keeping their heads up and trying to keep their side forward, and use slow, deliberate movements. When bucks are challenging each other, they rub their horns into vegetation and scrape them on the ground. They rub the scent glands on their heads and faces into plants and objects. They usually do not fight, but just spar with each other, and they do commonly bite. When they feel danger, they hide low in the foliage and hold, and then bound off about 100-200 meters. If they are alone, they may just quietly slip away. Females with a fawn will fake a limp to distract a predator. Pampas deer usually feed during the day, but sometimes have nocturnal activity. They are very curious and like to explore. They often stand on their hind legs to reach food or see over something. They are sedentary and don't have seasonal or even daily movements.",
            "WhatItEats": "Pampas deer are herbivorous animals. They eat new green growth, shrubs, and herbs. Thye prefer forbs, shoots, leaves, and twigs. During the rainy season, their diet will also include new grasses.",
            "ageRange": "12 to 20 Years",
            "Threats": "Pampas deer are threatened due to over-hunting and poaching, habitat loss due to agriculture, diseases from domesticated and feral livestock, competition from more recently introduced wildlife, and general over-exploitation. There is less than 1% of their natural habitat left. Pampas deer have been harvested into the millions. Between 1860 and 1870, documents for the port of Buenos Aires alone show that two million Pampas deer pelts were sent to Europe. Many years later, as roads were built through the pampas, cars made it even easier for poachers to get to the deer. They were also killed for food, medicinal purposes, and for sport. The settlers brought large agricultural expansion, uncontrolled hunting, and new diseases to Pampas deer with the introduction of new domestic and feral animals. Some landowners have set aside some of their property as a reserve for the deer, as well as keeping cattle instead of sheep. Sheep graze much more on the land and are more of a threat to the deer.",

            "Description": "Sables are small graceful martens found in Eurasia. The color of their highly valuable fur varies geographically and ranges from light to dark brown, with the individual coloring being lighter ventrally and darker on the back and legs. Japanese sables, in particular, are marked with black on their legs and feet. Some individuals also display a light patch of fur on their throat which may be gray, white, or pale yellow. The winter pelage of Sables is longer and more luxurious than the summer coat.",
            "Habitat": "Sables are solitary creatures. They defend home territories that may be anything from 4 to 30 square kilometers (1.5 to 11.6 sq mi) in size, depending on local terrain and food availability. However, when resources are scarce they may move 6 to 12 kilometers (3.7 to 7.5 mi) per day in search of food. They mark their territory with the scent produced in glands on the abdomen. Sables are mainly terrestrial but may climb well if they need to. Thee are primarily crepuscular, hunting during the hours of twilight, but become more active in the day during the mating season. They hunt primarily by sound and scent, and they have an acute sense of hearing. Sables live in burrows near riverbanks and in the thickest parts of woods. These burrows are usually dug among tree roots; they are well hidden, and lined by grass and shed fur, but may be temporary, especially during the winter, when the animal travels more widely in search of prey.",
            "WhatItEats": "Sables are omnivores, and their diet varies seasonally. In the summer, they eat large numbers of hare and other small mammals. In winter, they feed on wild berries, pine nuts, rodents, hares, and even small musk deer. They also hunt ermine, small weasels and birds. Sometimes, Sables follow the tracks of wolves and bears and feed on the remains of their kills. They eat mollusks such as slugs, which they rub on the ground in order to remove the mucus. Sables also occasionally eat fish, which they catch with their front paws.",
            "ageRange": "8 to 18 Years",
            "Threats": "Historically, Sables have been hunted for their dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. Their fur has been a highly valued item in the fur trade since the early Middle Ages; Sables are generally considered to have the most beautiful and richly tinted pelt among martens. While hunting is still common in Russia, it doesn't pose a serious threat to this species as most fur on the market is now commercially farmed. However, Sables do suffer from the loss of their habitat due to the clear-felling of forests, logging, and the development of new oil and gas mines.",

Females do not build nests but use all their energy for producing eggs, sometimes over three dozen per summer. They lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, who become their chicks’ foster parents, with usually at least some of their foster parents’ chicks being victims in the process. Heavy parasitism by this species has pushed some birds to being \"endangered\" and has affected other populations as well.",
            "Habitat": "These birds are social but are usually more solitary during the mornings, which is when mating occurs. Females also seek host nests in the mornings. During the afternoons, birds gather in flocks to forage. They walk on the ground to forage, feeding away from vegetation. In winter, they congregate in very big flocks with European starlings and other icterids. Roosting populations may number up to 38 million individuals. A hierarchy is established in social settings based on how many displacements, flight whistles and song spreads there are in the repertoire of a male. To determine hierarchy, cowbirds participate in \"triangle and quadrangle ceremonies\", during which males stand in a circle and perform song spreads. After social status is determined, it is usually maintained by nonverbal means. Singing in flocks is mostly performed by the dominant male and this may be enforced, if inferior males try to sing, by attacking them.",

Juveniles are light green or brownish-green with various darker patterns along the flanks and on the back. Two darker patches appear in the form of lines running on the top of the flanks. The head in juveniles also features several distinctive dark spots and they also have a yellow collar on the neck. Adults are much more uniform, sometimes being olive-yellow, brownish-green, sometimes almost black. Often in adults, there may be a more or less regular pattern of white-edged dorsal scales appearing as white freckles all over the body up to moiré-like structures in places, enhancing the shiny metallic appearance. Sometimes, especially when pale in color, two darker longitudinal lines along the flanks can be visible. The belly is plain yellow to off-white, while the round iris has amber to ochre coloration.",
            "Habitat": "Aesculapian snakes are solitary and active by day. In the warmer months of the year, they come out in late afternoon or early morning. They are very good climbers and are able to climb even vertical, branchless tree trunks. These snakes may climb as high as 4-5 m and even 15-20 m in trees, and forage in the roofs of buildings. They try to avoid exposure to direct sunlight and cease activity with more extreme heat. Aesculapian snakes can be active even during hibernation, moving around to keep a body temperature near 5 °C and occasionally emerging to bask on sunny days. They usually stay within their home ranges, however, during the mating season males will travel up to 2 km to find females and females to find suitable hatching sites to lay eggs. These snakes are deemed secretive and not always easy to find. In contact with humans, they can be rather tame, possibly due to their cryptic coloration keeping them hidden within their natural environment. They usually disappear and hide, but if cornered they may sometimes stand their ground and try to intimidate their opponent, sometimes with a chewing-like movement of the mouth and occasionally biting.",
            "WhatItEats": "Aesculapian snakes are carnivores. Their main food source is rodents up to the size of rats and other small mammals such as shrews and moles. They also eat birds as well as bird eggs and nestlings. Juveniles mainly eat lizards and arthropods, later small rodents.",
            "ageRange": "25 to 30 Years",
            "Threats": "The main threats to Aesculapian snakes include human-caused habitat destruction and persecution by people.

It is the longest native snake species in the U.S. These snakes have uniform blue-black dorsal and lateral scales, with some specimens having a reddish-orange to tan color on the throat, cheeks, and chin. They received their common name from the glossy iridescent ventral scales which can be seen as blackish-purple in bright light. Unlike many snakes, mature male indigo snakes are slightly larger than females.",
            "Habitat": "Eastern indigo snakes are solitary and diurnal creatures. Because the cover requirements of these snakes change seasonally, they maintain corridors that link these different habitats. From the spring through fall snakes must be able to travel from sandhill communities and upland pine-hardwood communities to creek bottoms and agricultural fields. In winter, they den in gopher tortoise burrows, which are usually found in open pine forests with dense herbaceous understories. Eastern indigo snakes may even cohabit with gopher tortoises in their burrows, although snakes will settle for armadillo holes, hollow logs, and debris piles when gopher tortoise burrows can't be found. Burrows need to be in areas where there is no flooding. Eastern indigo snakes heavily use debris piles left from site-preparation operations on tree plantations. These piles are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons but should be left intact because they provide important hiding cover for both the snake and its prey. Summer home ranges for indigo snakes can be as large as 273 acres (110 hectares). As defensive behavior, Eastern indigo snakes vertically flatten their neck, hiss, and vibrate their tail. If picked up, they seldom bite.",
            "WhatItEats": "Eastern indigo snakes are carnivorous, like all snakes, and will eat any other small animal they can overpower. They eat turtles, lizards, frogs, toads, a variety of small birds and mammals, and eggs. Their diet also includes other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous ones, as indigo snakes are immune to the venom of the North American rattlesnakes.",
            "ageRange": "17 to 25 Years",
            "Threats": "Eastern indigo snakes are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation and collecting for the pet trade. They also suffer from \"gassing\" of tortoise burrows. As these snakes often cohabit with gopher tortoises in their burrows, hunters, hoping to flush out rattlesnakes, often wind up accidentally killing indigo snakes when they illegally pour gasoline into the burrows of gopher tortoises.",

Their body is black, with golden to orange limbs and paws. Their tail is black with golden in color. When threatened or alarmed, these tamarins raise their beautiful mane and fluff up their fur that makes them look bigger than they really are. Males and females in this species look alike and are similar in size.",
            "Habitat": "Golden-headed lion tamarins live in groups ranging from 2 to 11 individuals, with the average size ranging from 4 to 7. According to various sources, the group may consist of two adult males, one adult female, and any immature individuals, one male and one female and any immature individuals. There may also be one producing pair and a varying number of other group members, usually offspring from previous generations. These tamarins are diurnal and spend much of their time foraging and traveling within their home range to the next foraging site. They prefer to live at heights of 3-10 meters and do not even come down to sleep at night. They sleep in tree holes or vines. In order to communicate with each other, Golden-headed lion tamarins use different vocalizations. They use trills while remaining alone and clucks during foraging. Long calls are usually used when tamarins are guarding the territory.",
            "WhatItEats": "Golden-headed lion tamarins are omnivores. They have a very wide diet and eat plants, fruits, flowers, nectar, insects and small invertebrates; which include insect larvae, spiders, snails, frogs, lizards, bird eggs and small snakes.",
            "ageRange": "21 Years",
            "Threats": "The main threat to Golden-headed lion tamarins is the loss of the habitat. The forest of Bahia, Brazil has been reduced to 2% due to farming, ranching, mining, and urbanization. The Atlantic Forest is highly fragmented, and the disappearance of this habitat is the main reason for the Golden-headed lion tamarin's decline. The majority of the forest was once dominated by cocoa plants through a method known as cabruca. This is a system of shade cropping in which the middle and understory trees are removed and replaced with cocoa trees. Although tamarins' habitat is reduced, they still leave old growth trees which give them a place to forage and to sleep. In 1989 farmers abandoned their cocoa plants due to a fungus that attacked their harvest.

            "Description": "The Oriental garden lizard is an insectivorous lizard found in indo-Malaya. It has also been introduced in many other parts of the world. The lizard is generally a light brownish olive, but it can change its ground-color to bright red, to black, and to a mixture of both. This change is sometimes confined to the head, at other times diffused over the whole body and tail. During the breeding season, the male's head and shoulders turn bright orange to crimson and his throat black. Males also turn red-headed after a successful battle with rivals. Both males and females have a crest from the head to nearly the tail, hence their other common name \"Crested Tree Lizard\".",
            "Habitat": "Oriental garden lizards spend most of their time in low shrubs and tree trunks trying to stay undetected. They are solitary and diurnal; on a hot sunny day may often be seen on a twig or on a wall, basking in the sun, with mouth wide open. After a shower of rain numbers of these lizards may come down on the ground and pick up the larva and small insects that fall from the trees during the showers. Oriental garden lizards have teeth that are designed for gripping prey and not tearing it up. So they swallow their catch whole after it is stunned by shaking it about.",

Despite their short legs, Eurasian teal are also rather nimble on the ground by ducks' standards. Diurnal throughout the breeding season, in winter they are often crepuscular or even nocturnal feeders. They usually feed by dabbling, upending, or grazing; they may submerge their head and on occasion even dive to reach food. Eurasian teal are quite noisy.

Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips.",
            "Habitat": "Bohemian waxwings are social birds. They forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, and in winter roost communally in dense trees or hedges, sometimes with American robins, fieldfares, or other wintering species. Waxwings feed by day catching insects mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but may also pick their prey off vegetation. Fruits and berries are normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and are usually swallowed whole. When alarmed, Bohemian waxwings \"freeze\" with bill and neck pointing upwards. If this fails, they fly, calling noisily. The common call of these birds is a high trill 'sirrrr'. Other calls are just variants of the main vocalization; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range.",

This white patch gives the wigeon its other common name, baldpate (pate is another word for head). Their belly is also white. In flight, drakes can be identified by the large white shoulder patch on each wing. These white patches flash as the birds bank and turn. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female. The female (a hen) is much less conspicuous, having primarily gray and brown plumage. Both sexes have a pale blue bill with a black tip, a white belly, and gray legs and feet.",

They are active during the day and usually feed by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which they do very readily. While on the water, wigeons often gather with feeding coots and divers and are known to grab pieces of vegetation brought to the surface by diving water birds. For this reason, they are sometimes called \"poacher\" or \"robber\" ducks. American wigeons also commonly feed on dry land, eating waste grain in harvested fields and grazing on pasture grasses, winter wheat, clover, and lettuce. Having a largely vegetarian diet, most birds migrate in the fall well before northern marshes begin to freeze. American wigeons are quite noisy and in the field can often be identified by their distinctive calls. Drakes produce a three-note whistle, while hens emit hoarse grunts and quacks. The male whistle makes a 'wheezy whoee-whoe-whoe', whereas the female has a low growl 'qua-ack'.",

            "Description": "The Japanese white-eye is a small songbird native to much of east Asia. As one of the native species of the Japanese islands, it has been depicted in Japanese art on numerous occasions, and historically was kept as a cage bird. This bird is olive green on its back, from anterior to posterior, and is pale green on its underside. Its feet, legs, and bill range from black to brown. It has a green forehead and a yellow throat. The white-eye has rounded wings and a long, slender bill - both of which indicate this bird to be very acrobatic. Its wings are dark brown but outlined in green. Like other white-eyes, this bird has the distinctive white eyering that gives it its name.",
            "Habitat": "Japanese white-eyes are diurnal birds that are rarely found on the ground. They are very sociable and outside of the breeding season may form flocks with other species; in these flocks, the birds form groups in which they forage during flight. There is a social hierarchy in a flock that is established through physical displays. Some of these displays include wing flicks exposing the underwing, wing flutters, and vibrations, as well as open beak displays and beak snaps (rapid shutting of the beak to make a snapping noise). Japanese white-eyes feed on insects by searching the leaves of flowers and scouring tree bark for larvae.",

            "Description": "The markhor is a large species of wild goat native to Central Asia. It's coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black color, and is smooth and short in summer; it grows longer and thicker in winter. The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Males have longer hair on the chin, throat, chest, and shanks. Females are redder in color, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head but spread upwards toward the tips.",
            "Habitat": "Markhor are diurnal animals and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods, they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. Markhor live in flocks that usually consisit of nine animals. These flocks are composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population. These majestic animals have many predators and that's why possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above.",
            "WhatItEats": "Markhor are herbivores (folivores, graminivores). They feed on various grasses, leaves, twigs, and shrubs.",
            "ageRange": "10 to 13 Years",
            "Threats": "Poaching, with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, is by far the most important factor threatening the survival of the markhor population. Poaching causes fragmentation of the population. into small islands where the remaining subpopulations are prone to extinction. The markhor is a valued trophy hunting prize for its incredibly rare spiral horns which became a threat to their species. Markhor are potential prey for snow leopards, brown bears, lynx, jackals, and golden eagles. While not directly causing their endangerment, the already small population of markhor is further threatened by their predation.",

It is reddish-brown on top of the head, dark roan brown on the body, and mottled white on the underbelly. The face is lighter in color than the body, and the muzzle and chin are white. The ears are rounded. The eyes are unusually far forward and close together, compared with other cats, giving the felid improved stereoscopic vision. These cats have fairly short legs and retractable claws. Their jaws are relatively powerful and teeth are adapted for gripping onto slippery prey.",
            "Habitat": "Flat-headed cats are presumably solitary, and probably maintain their home ranges by scent marking. Historical accounts report that Flat-headed cats are nocturnal, but an adult captive female was crepuscular and most active between 8:00 and 11:30 and between 18:00 and 22:00 hours. Flat-headed cats have been observed to wash objects, raccoon-style. They hunt with full submergence of the head, and the fish were usually carried at least two meters away. Captive specimens show much greater interest in potential prey in the water than on dry land. Vocalizations of a flat-headed cat kitten resembled those of a domestic cat. The vocal repertoire of adults has not been analyzed completely, but they purr and give other short-ranged vocalizations.",
            "WhatItEats": "Flat-headed cats are carnivores. Their diet is mostly composed of fish, but they are reported to hunt for frogs, and are thought to catch crustaceans. They also catch rats and chicken.",
            "ageRange": "14 Years",
            "Threats": "The Flat-headed cat is primarily threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat. Flat-headed cats are also threatened by trapping, snaring and poisoning.

The underparts and feet are always white, while the pale fur on the throat region is gray at its base. The tail is distinctly bicolored, and has more hair, and fewer visible scales, than the tails of brown rats. Desert woodrats have a narrow snout, long whiskers, and relatively long ears that are almost the length of the hind feet.",
            "Habitat": "Desert woodrats are primarily nocturnal and are aggressively solitary. They may defend water sources against other species, and perhaps prevent other species from obtaining water during droughts. Woodrats construct houses for nesting, food caching, and predator escape. Their houses are located against rock crevices, at the base of cactus plants, or in the lower branches of trees. They can have up to 6 entrances and 8 internal chambers, including both nests and food caches. Nests are constructed of dried vegetation, usually fibrous grass parts or shredded stems. Desert woodrats sometimes appropriate the burrows of ground squirrels or kangaroo rats. They will strengthen the entrance with sticks and joints collected from cactus. This provides a formidable defense against predators. Males mark their territory by rubbing themselves on the ground. Females, however, scent mark by first digging, and then rubbing their flanks, legs or cheeks on the excavated soil. They are active year-round.",
            "WhatItEats": "Desert woodrats are herbivores and granivores. They feed on beans and leaves of mesquite, on juniper, and on parts of available cacti. They also eat creosote bushes, thistles, Ephedra, Mustard plants, sagebrush, and buckwheat. Desert woodrats will also eat other green vegetation, seeds, fruits, acorns, and pine nuts.",

They are tan to rufous-tawny in color with slightly lighter underparts, predominantly white inner ears, and a white tail. These antelopes have very sharp horns which are ridged along three-quarters of their length. As hirola age, their coat darkens becoming slate grey and the number of ridges along their horns increases. Hirola have large, dark sub-orbital glands used for marking their territories and give them the name \"four-eyed antelope\". They have white spectacles around their eyes and an inverted white chevron running between the eyes. The horns, hooves, udders, nostrils, lips and ear tips are black. Males and females look similar although males are slightly larger with thicker horns and darker coats.",
            "Habitat": "Hirola are crepuscular creatures and feed mostly around sunrise and then again right after sunset. They are social and most of the time live in small groups of 15-40 individuals; these groups consist of females and their offspring, and a dominant male. Depending on the time of year these small groups may form herds of several hundred individuals. Males that do not have a harem often form bachelor groups of up to 5 individuals and when juveniles reach 1 year of age they form their own separate groups. Adult males are territorial; their territories are marked with dung, secretions from the sub-orbital glands and by stamping grounds where males scrape the soil with their hooves and slash the vegetation with their horns. When males defend their harem or their territory they drop to their knees in a serious fight with the opponent and sometimes such fights become very fierce. Hirola are often found in association with other species such as oryx, Grant's gazelles, Burchell's zebras, and topi; they avoid Coke's hartebeests, buffalo, and elephants.",
            "WhatItEats": "Hirola are herbivorous animals. They are specialized grazers and prefer newly sprouted grass. These antelopes can stay long periods without drinking water.",

            "Threats": "Disease (particularly rinderpest), poaching, severe drought, predation, competition for food and water from domestic livestock and habitat loss are main threats to these antelopes. Hirola prefer areas that are used by livestock which puts them at increased risk from diseases like tuberculosis. Due to the lack of protection, they are also still very vulnerable to poaching.

Each colony includes a single, dominant male, up to 3 females, sometimes with a subordinate adult male, and a number of young and subadults up to 2 years of age. These marmots hibernate 7-8 months a year in burrows they excavate in the soil, often among or under boulders. Each colony typically maintain a single burrow for hibernation and a number of smaller burrows which they use for sleeping and refuge from predators. Each colony digs an average of 5 such burrows a year, and a mature colony may have over a hundred. Closer to hibernation time Hoary marmots like to socialise through play fighting, wrestling, social grooming, and nose-to-nose touching. These animals use at least seven distinct types of calls, including chirps, whistles, growls, and whining sounds. Many of these calls are used as alarms, alerting other animals to potential predators.",

Males of this porpoise are larger and more robust than females. As opposed to other porpoise species, Dall's porpoise lacks tubercles or bumps on the front edge of its dorsal fin. The latter is small and triangular, and can angle forward. This agile porpoise is one of the fastest cetaceans: when swimming, the animal leaves behind itself a \"rooster tail\" of water. The snout of the animal is blunt and the flippers are small. The stocky body is dark gray to black, covered with white spots and exhibiting white markings on the tail and dorsal fin.",
            "Habitat": "These animals usually gather in small groups, consisting of 10 - 20 porpoises. However, there have been reported concentrations of more than 200 individuals. Normally, they are not seen in mixed groups with other species, but in the northern part of their range, particularly, in the deep waters off Alaska and in Prince William Sound, Dall's porpoises can occasionally be observed with Harbor porpoises. In addition, they have been seen in a company of Gray whales. Dall's porpoises are known to migrate, travelling north in summer and moving to south by winter. Unlike other porpoise species, Dall's porpoises are not at all shy and secretive: on the contrary, these animals can often be observed bow-riding and charging boats. Being night feeders, they use echolocation to hunt prey, navigate in the ocean and, likely, to communicate with each other. In addition, they use touch as well as a number of sounds, including clicks and whistles, as forms of communication.",
            "WhatItEats": "Dall’s porpoises are carnivores (piscivores and molluscivores). Their diet consists of lanternfish, Pacific hake, jack mackerel, herring, sardines, crustaceans and cephalopods, including squid.",

            "Threats": "Presently, the animal is threatened by pollutants and different contaminants in its marine habitat, found in the blubber of Dall’s porpoise. Accumulating and passing through the marine food web, these contaminants have negative affect on reproduction, being an important toxicity concern. Furthermore, Dall’s porpoises are often incidentally caught in fishing gears, catching groundfish, salmon, and squid in the waters of Canada, Russia, Japan and U.S. (including Alaska).

It has no dorsal fin, instead having a series of bumps on the last third of its back along a dorsal ridge. It has two deep grooves on its throat, which enable its mouth to expand when it feeds. The baleen, which it uses to filter food, is creamy-white. When it surfaces, its 'blow' is distinctly bushy, and is short and ‘heart-shaped’ or forked, as it comes from a pair of blowholes. Females are usually larger than males and otherwise look the same as males.",
            "Habitat": "Gray whales feed mainly during the long daylight hours of the summer months and often feed near to the shore where the water is very shallow. They live in small groups, though sometimes form large pods, but don’t stay in the same group for all of their life; instead, the bonds they form are very loose and then they move on to another group. Gray whales exhibit the behavior of “spyhopping” - lifting their heads right out of the water, exposing their entire rostrum for some minutes. They do this while looking out for predators or other whales. They also “breach” (jumping up into the air then splashing down onto their back or side, known also as cresting or lunging), which is understood to be a form of communication, a form of play, and an attempt at removing skin parasites. This whale makes the furthest migration known by any mammal: each spring and autumn they go from their summer feeding waters in the Arctic to the warm equatorial lagoons where the females give birth.",

This blue skin is surrounded by another ring of bare, orange skin. The most noticeable feature of this bird, however, is its huge bill, which measures up to 23 cm (9 in) in length; it is yellow-orange in color and with a black base and large spot on the tip. It looks heavy, but as in other toucans, it is relatively light because the inside largely is hollow. The tongue is nearly as long as the bill and very flat. The male and the female are similar in appearance and juveniles are duller and shorter-billed than adults.",

The Tasmanian devil is a well-known, small marsupial the size of a small dog. The species is so called by the early European settlers due to its overall black coloration, bad-temper and the terrifying screeching sounds it emits. And indeed, this marsupial often has an aggressive behavior and is commonly known for its spine-chilling calls. Moreover, this animal has extremely strong jaws and teeth, allowing it to totally destroy its meal, including bones and fur.",

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family and they don't come from Guinea in Africa. The origin of their name is still unclear. They originated in the Andes of South America and studies suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Montane guinea pig, and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild. Due to a selective breeding, these animals have different hair colors and different coat textures and length.",
            "Habitat": "Domestic guinea pigs are social and thrive in groups of two or more individuals. Groups of females, or groups of one or more females and a neutered male are common, but males can sometimes live together. They are crepuscular animals, being active during dusk and dawn. Guinea pigs can jump small obstacles but are poor climbers, and are not agile. When they sense danger these animals either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid. When happily excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as \"popcorning\"). They are also good swimmers. Guinea pigs often self-groom and may sometimes participate in social grooming. Dominance within male groups is established through chewing each other's hair, biting (especially of the ears), aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Guinea pigs communicate through a variety of noises, including wheeks, rumbling, bubbling or purring, chattering, squealing or shrieking, chutting and whining.",

Only males have horns that are thin, straight and smooth at the tips and ringed at the base.",
            "Habitat": "Oribis are active mainly during the day, but sometimes may also be active at night. They are social and live in small groups that consist of up to four members. However, during the rainy season, when grasses are abundant, oribis can associate in bigger groups. Males are territorial and defend their group's territory from intruders. They mark vegetation and soil in their territories by preorbital gland secretions and excrement. Oribis have a very interesting behavior called the \"dung ceremony\", in which all animals form temporary dung middens. They do this in order to maintain social bonds within the group. When threatened, oribis prefer to hide in bushes or grasses and stay still with their ears down. If they are spotted, they will sprint through the open plain. After 200 m they may look back to see if they are still pursued, and will run again in a zig-zag motion in order to lose a predator. When alarmed oribis may make vertical leaps with straight legs; this behavior is called \"stotting\". When sensing danger these antelopes produce alarm whistles. These whistles are usually made by adults, and males appear to whistle more.",

These rabbits don't hibernate being active year-round. It is believed that there is a social hierarchy within the species especially when it comes to mating, in which the males assert their dominance by fighting to gain mating priority. Appalachian cottontails have acute senses of smell, hearing, and sight. This allows them to notice predators and react quickly to threats. Mothers may perform a grunting sound in order to alert her babies to the presence of predators. Their senses are also used to find potential mates.",

Their fur is blackish in color, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. Spectacled bears typically have distinctive beige or ginger-colored markings across their face and upper chest, though not all bears have \"spectacle\" markings. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions and sometimes twice their weight.",
            "Habitat": "The Spectacled bear is an arboreal species. In Andean cloud forests, they may be active both during the day and night, but in Peruvian desert are reported to bed down under vegetative cover during the day. Spectacled bears have an ability to climb even the tallest trees of the Andes due to their continued survival alongside humans. They usually retreat from the presence of humans, often by climbing trees. Once up a tree, they may often build a platform, perhaps to aid in concealment, as well as to rest and store food on. Although Spectacled bears are solitary and tend to isolate themselves from one another to avoid competition, they are not territorial. They may even feed in small groups at abundant food sources. Males are reported to have an average home range of 23 km2 (8.9 sq mi) during the wet season and 27 km2 (10 sq mi) during the dry season. Females have an average home range of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) in the wet season and 7 km2 (2.7 sq mi) in the dry season. When encountered by humans or other Spectacled bears, they will react in a docile but cautious manner, unless the intruder is seen as a threat or a mother's cubs are endangered. Like other bears, mothers are protective of their young and have attacked poachers.",
            "WhatItEats": "Spectacled bears are more herbivorous than most other bears and only about 5 to 7% of their diet is meat. The most common foods include cactus, bromeliads palm nuts, bamboo hearts, frailejon, orchid bulbs, fallen fruit on the forest floor, and unopened palm leaves. They also eat cultivated plants, such as sugarcane, honey, and corn, and may travel above the tree line for berries. Animal prey includes rabbits, mice, other rodents, birds at the nest, arthropods, and carrion.",

Poaching might have several reasons: trophy hunting, pet trade, religious or magical beliefs, natural products trade and conflicts with humans. Conflicts with humans, however, appear to be the most common cause of poaching in large portions of their distribution. Andean bears are often suspected of attacking cattle and raiding crops and are killed for retaliation or in order to avoid further damages. Perhaps the most epidemic problem for the species is extensive logging and farming, which has led to habitat loss for the largely tree-dependent bears. As little as 5% of the original habitat in Andean cloud forest remains. Shortage of natural food sources might push bears to feed on crops or livestock, increasing the conflict that usually results in poaching of an individual.",

            "Habitat": "Slender mongooses generally live either alone or in pairs. They are primarily diurnal, although they are sometimes active on warm, moonlit nights. Slender mongooses don't seem to be territorial, but will nevertheless maintain stable home ranges that are often shared with members of related species. Indeed, Slender mongooses and these other species may even den together, as most of their relatives are nocturnal. Dens may be found anywhere sheltered from the elements: in crevices between rocks, in hollow logs, and the like. Slender mongooses are more adept at climbing trees than other mongooses, often hunting nesting birds there and eggs. When mongooses get excited, the hairs on their back and tail may be raised. They can hiss at one another, as well. When they are disturbed, they usually freeze, either on just their hind legs or on all four. When threatening predators these animals will spit and growl; when two mongooses attack each other they snarl. When females see their mate during the breeding season they produce a buzzing sound. The ‘huh-new’ is a distress call. Scent-marking is usually used for territorial purposes and mate marking.",
            "WhatItEats": "Slender mongooses are primarily carnivorous, though they are opportunistic omnivores. Insects make up the bulk of their diet, but lizards, rodents, snakes, birds, amphibians, and the occasional fruit are eaten when available. They will also eat carrion and eggs.",

It is relatively small and slim-bodied, with long legs and plumage that is mostly black or blackish-slate. ‘Shining raven’ is the meaning of its scientific name, referring to its glossy, jet-black feathers around the face, chin, crown, and throat. Males and females are similar in appearance. Juveniles have duller plumage which does not feature the adults’ glossy black sheen.",
            "Habitat": "A House crow is very intelligent and is always wary and alert, walking or hopping along while flicking its wings nervously. It is a diurnal, non-migratory, social species and gathers in noisy flocks and forms massive roosts. The flocks may consist of hundreds or thousands of birds, and this species will also gather with parakeets and mynahs in plantations and mangroves. House crows return to their foraging grounds just prior to dawn. It is a very noisy species, with a rather dry, flat, toneless call described as a ‘kaaan-kaaan’ or ‘kaa-kaao’. During social interactions they also make a wide range of softer, nasal calls.",

However, colonies of this species in many areas have reached pest proportions, have spread rapidly and are regarded as invasive. They cause economic damage by destroying crops and fruit and eating the eggs and chicks of domestic poultry. Singapore, Yemen and some islands have tried hard to control House crow populations, and have had mixed success.

The squirrel's tail is often edged with white and is not as thick as in other tree squirrels in North America. Its large black eyes are encircled by white bands. This squirrel's compact, muscled body, strong claws, and strong back legs make it good at climbing and running through trees.",
            "Habitat": "Red squirrels are mostly active during the day but sometimes they will be active during the night. In spring and summer their most active periods are mornings and afternoons, but coming into autumn they are very active all day as they get ready for the winter food shortages. Both male and female squirrels will vigorously defend exclusive territories against competitors. Aside from mothers with their young, the red squirrel is a solitary creature. Its nest is called a drey and can be made in different places, such as tree hollows or crotches, or hollows in the ground or in logs. It is very vocal animal, making sounds of chattering, growling and screeching.",
            "WhatItEats": "The American red squirrel eats acorns, hazelnuts, seeds from other deciduous trees, shoots, berries, fruit, birds' eggs, and mushrooms.

The Indian cobra is revered in Indian mythology and culture and is often seen with snake charmers. These snakes vary tremendously in color and pattern throughout their range. The ventral scales or the underside coloration of this species can be grey, yellow, tan, brown, reddish or black. Dorsal scales may have a hood mark or color patterns. Salt-and-pepper speckles, especially in adult specimens, are seen on the dorsal scales. Indian cobras can easily be identified by their relatively large and quite impressive hood, which they expand when threatened. Many specimens exhibit a hood mark. This hood mark is located at the rear of the Indian cobra's hood. When the hood mark is present, are two circular ocelli patterns connected by a curved line, evoking the image of spectacles.",

Indian cobras find their shelter in holes in embankments, tree hollows, termite mounds, rock piles, and small mammal dens. When threatened, these snakes take the characteristic posture they are famous for. They raise the front of the body and expand their distinctive hood, on which are resembled eyes-like hood marks. Indian cobras are one of the big four snakes of South Asia which are responsible for the majority of human deaths by snakebite in Asia. The venom of young cobras has been used as a substance of abuse in India, with cases of snake charmers being paid for providing bites from their snakes. Though this practice is now seen as outdated, symptoms of such abuse include loss of consciousness, euphoria, and sedation.",

They also have a special flying ability, with broad wings that enable great powers of flight. They are curious, they are great mimics, and they use tools.",
            "Habitat": "Pied crows are very social birds and commonly forage in pairs or small groups, but also gather in large flocks where food is abundant. They sleep in communal roosts in urban parks in large trees with many hundreds of other birds. This bird is known for mobbing bigger birds: small birds of prey up to large vultures. It may itself be mobbed by smaller birds. It will also pirate seabirds for food. This species is generally sedentary within its large range. Some seasonal or local movements occur, depending on the range. Movements have been seen after breeding: adults are probably sedentary, while the young move to new territories. The pied crow, like many crows, makes the typical guttural “kraaak” sound, or short “krow” or deeper “rrawrr”. It also makes a dry rattle “tarrrrrh” or “torrrrrh”. Other sounds are nasal, throaty, hollow and flat, and often there is head-bobbing and movements of the tail at the same time.",

It has a distinctive appearance, having a large crest and one of the biggest beaks of any parrot, a beak unusual in itself, as the upper and lower mandibles do not meet along much of the length, which allows the bird’s tongue to hold a nut in place against its top mandible while its lower mandible does the work to open it. Between the eyes and the beak there is a patch of bare skin, red in color. There is also a distinctive red patch on the cheek that changes color if the bird is excited or alarmed. In young birds, their underfeathers are lined with pale yellow and in birds under the age of 18 months, the tip of the beak and the ring around the eye are white.",
            "Habitat": "Palm cockatoos are found alone, in pairs, or in larger groups. Sometimes they stay quite close by their nesting sites, but they can travel a long way to search for food or water. A few trees for nesting sites are included within their territory. They visit these sites during the year for a variety of reasons, increasing the visiting frequency in the breeding season. Often they feed in big groups, one \"sentinel\" bird watching out for predators. Should a predator or another threat appear, the “sentinel” makes an alarm cry to warn the flock. These cockatoos are highly social birds, gathering early in the day in groups in their favorite locations to spend time interacting and preening. They roost during the day near sources of food or water and at night they roost in or nearby a nest tree. During the rain they can be found, as if taking a shower, hanging upside down, stretching out their wings and tails.",

The last known sea mink was taken from an island in the Gulf of Maine in 1880, the year attributed to being its last year of existence. Little is known about this species as it was exterminated from its native range before any scientists could analyze it. It was almost fifty percent bigger than its closest relatives. Their body was flatter in comparison to the American mink. Their tail was long and bushy and they had a coarser reddish-brown coat. The females were shorter than the males. Their lifespan was not known. The American mink, a close relative, lives on average for 6 years in the wild, 10 years in captivity.",
            "Habitat": "No information is available about the general behavior of this species. However, they were known to be solitary and territorial. Males were aggressive towards each other, especially during the mating season or during any territorial disputes. They would mark territory along a shoreline with specific scents. If trespassing took place, violent interactions would occur. Despite minks probably having poor underwater eyesight, it would have spent much time in the ocean, hunting for its preferred prey.",
            "WhatItEats": "The Sea minks were carnivores (piscivores), they ate fish, seabirds, probably the Labrador duck, as well as seabird eggs, marine invertebrates, and some insects.",
            "ageRange": "6 to 10 Years",
            "Threats": "The Sea mink was hunted until it became extinct, due to unregulated removal and killing for an expanding European fur trade. Before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans were capturing these animals and using their pelts and most likely their meat, although their level of hunting was less intensive and would not have depleted numbers to the level where it was unsustainable. Low numbers of surviving young would have contributed to the sea mink’s inability to survive pressure from the fur trade. Much could be learnt from this species’ extinction, most important being the need for strictly regulating the numbers of individuals harvested from a population.",

Other notable differences include: tassels on the end of their tails as well as bunches of hair on their elbows are longer than these of African lions; unlike their African cousins, Asian lions are clearly identified by long folds of skin, stretched along their bellies; their manes are shorter than these of African lions, so the ears are seen. Being cats, Asian lions possess strong retractable claws and sharp canine teeth. The color of their fur varies from buffish-grey with occasional silvery tones, to ruddy-tawny, covered with black spots.",

The prides can contain only 2 adult females whereas those of African lions may include 4-6 adult females. The largest unit of Asian lionesses, ever recorded, consisted of just 5 females. However, male lions are not as sociable as females, joining the pride mainly for mating and on a large kill. Although hunting takes cooperation, adult males don’t tend to take part in it. In areas with little vegetation lions go hunting at night while in areas with thick vegetation they can hunt during the daytime. These lions are comparably passive for most of the day: they can rest and sleep 20 hours per day.",

The lions display sexual dimorphism with males, having their distinctive manes, ranging in color from black to blond. They develop their manes at the age of 3 years. Meanwhile, manes of those, living in open areas, are notably fuller. The mane makes lion look much larger than it is, helping the animal intimidate the opponent during confrontations with other lions as well the Spotted Hyena, which is the animal's primary competitor throughout its range. Young lions have grayish coat, covered with brown markings, which then disappear by the age of 3 months. However, lions in eastern Africa tend to retain these spots on their stomach.",
            "Habitat": "These animals can be either nocturnal, being active at night, or crepuscular, showing increased activity at dusk and before sunset. Lions spend the greater part of the day (up to 20 hours) resting. These animals rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey or to escape the midday heat. African lions are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's a harsh competition between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case if another male overcomes the leading male of the pride, he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger and faster than them.",
            "WhatItEats": "Lions are carnivorous animals. These predators primarily hunt on zebras, antelopes, gazelles, deer, buffalos, young giraffes, warthogs, wildebeest, young elephants, less frequently – on hares and birds.

They also congregate into more intimate social units – subgroups - that contain 10-15 individuals on average. They can move from one subgroup to another, depending on their needs. Since the sea lions are non-migratory animals, they usually remain near to their birthplace throughout the life, living and breeding on sandy beaches. Looking for food, they can dive up to 600 feet, staying up to 40 minutes under the water.

            "Habitat": "Steller sea lions are usually social and occur in large groups on beaches or in rookeries. They are usually in groups of two to twelve, but sometimes there are up to a hundred individuals together. At sea, they are solitary or in small groups. They forage at night near the shore and in pelagic waters. They can travel long distances during a season and are able to dive to about 1300 feet (400 m). They use land as haul-out sites to rest, molt, mate and give birth. They produce powerful vocalizations accompanied, in males, by vertical head bobbing.",
            "WhatItEats": "Steller sea lions are carnivores (piscivores, molluscivores), they mainly eat Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and Pacific salmon. They also eat octopus, squid, gastropods and bivalves. They also kill harbor seals, ringed seals, younger northern fur seals and other animals.",
            "ageRange": "20 to 30 Years",
            "Threats": "Current threats to this species include: boat/ship strikes, illegal hunting/shooting, contaminants/pollutants, habitat degradation, offshore gas and oil exploration, interactions (indirect and direct) with fisheries, direct impacts largely because of fishing gear (set and drift gillnets, longlines, trawls, etc.) which can hook, entangle, injure, or kill them, and indirect impacts from competition for food, possible changes to critical habitat, etc.",

Their color may range from green to lavender, red, orange, black, and even reddish brown. They can also be bluish in color with bold blue markings. Green iguanas have a row of spines along their backs and along their tails, which helps to protect them from predators. Their whip-like tails can be used to deliver painful strikes and like many other lizards, when grabbed by the tail, the iguana can allow it to break, so it can escape and eventually regenerate a new one. In addition, iguanas have a well-developed dewlap, which helps regulate their body temperature. This dewlap is used in courtships and territorial displays.",

Collectively these dolphin species are known by the common name blackfish. Melon-headed whales have a rounded cone head which gives the animal its common name. The color of the body is light grey except for a dark grey face – sometimes called the \"mask\". The flippers are long and pointed. The dorsal fin is tall with a pointed tip.",
            "Habitat": "Melon-headed whales are very social animals. They live in large groups numbering between 100 and 1,000. Within these large groups, they usually swim in smaller groups of 10-14. They have been seen swimming close to each other and touching flippers. Groups of the Melon-headed whales mix with groups of Fraser’s dolphins and socialize with them. They also associate with Humpback whales and Pilot whales. Melon-headed whales spend much of their daytime at the surface resting. When resting near the surface, they create large splashes when they break the water. Several of them rise vertically out of the water to observe their surroundings and then splash back down. This technique is known as spy hopping. These whales are capable of very fast swimming, particularly when startled. In flight, they often make short, low jumps clear of the sea surface, splashing lots of water.",

Their winter fur is very dense, soft and fluffy, with guard hairs reaching 3-4 cm in length. The underfur is dense and loose fitting. Siberian weasels are monotone in color, being bright reddish-ocherous or straw-red, though orange or peach tones are sometimes noticeable on the skin. A dark, coffee-brown mask is present on the face. Their tails are more brightly colored than the back and are fluffier than those of other members of the genus. The lips and chin are white or slightly ochreous. The front of the muzzle is darker than the remaining parts of the head.",
            "Habitat": "Siberian weasels are nocturnal creatures. They are solitary and maintain territories, however, at times when food is scarce, they can leave their home range and move up to 8 km in a single night. Siberian weasels are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses. They typically eat about 100-120 g of food daily and cache excess food. These creatures are not fussy about their shelters. They may nest inside fallen logs, empty stumps, brushwood piles, and exposed tree roots. They also use and enlarge the dens of other animals. The length of their burrows range from 0.6-4.2 meters and are 0.2-1.3 meters deep. The nesting chamber, which is located in the middle or end of the passage, is lined with bird feathers and rodent wool. In addition to a permanent burrow, adults have up to five temporary shelters which may be separated from each other by several kilometers. Siberian weasels are extremely aggressive when caught threatened, emitting piercing shrieks and letting loose a pungent secretion which reportedly takes a month to wash away.",
            "WhatItEats": "Siberian weasels are carnivorous animals that hunt mainly on rodents. They feed on voles, mice, pikas, chipmunks, muskrats, Red squirrels and jerboas.

Their legs are slender and slightly lighter on the inner surfaces, with black and white markings just above the hooves. There are large black spots on the upper forelegs. The bridge of the nose is charcoal black, and there is a thin, indistinct tan-colored line, which is the chevron, between the eyes. Both sexes have tightly spiraled, 'V'-shaped horns, however, males' horns are thicker at the ends, longer, and more divergent. Males in this species are also larger than females.",
            "Habitat": "Great elands are nocturnal animals that have large home ranges and seasonal migration patterns. They are social and form separate groups of males and of females and juveniles. Adult males mainly remain alone and often spend time with females for an hour to a week. Giant eland herds usually consist of 15-25 animals (sometimes even more) and do not disband during the wet season. During the day, herds often rest in sheltered areas. As many other animals do, Giant elands scrape mineral lick sites with the help of horns to loosen the soil. These animals are alert and wary. If a male senses danger, he will give deep-throated barks while leaving the herd, repeating the process until the whole herd is aware of the danger. Giant elands can move quickly, and despite their size are good jumpers. They can jump up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) high. Giant elands have many predators, however, they are not easily taken by any predator, especially heavy and large horned males which can be dangerous even for a lion pride.",

There is usually a stripe of darker hair down the center of the back and onto the tail, and some males have saddle-like patches on the back in the winter. The undersides are paler, and, in the winter, mature males becoming much darker with white patches. Females and infants are generally blander in color and do not always have the stripe down the back. Siberian ibexes typically molt between April and July, developing their paler summer coat, which continues to grow and become darker during the year, reaching the full winter condition around December. Both sexes have beards and horns. The female's horns are relatively small, and grey-brown in color. Those of fully-grown males are black. Both sexes have circular rings around their horns that represent annual growth, but males also have large transverse ridges along the front surface.",
            "Habitat": "Siberian ibexes live in herds that vary in size depending on the local population; about 5-30 is most common, although they can become much larger during the rut. Outside of the rut, most herds are single-sex, although some mixed-sex herds persist throughout the year. Siberian ibexes are diurnal and spend much of the day grazing, staying an hour or more at each location before moving on. Usually living at high elevations, Siberian ibexes seek out lower slopes during the winter in search of food. They seek out shaded areas with vegetation on hot days but do not enter forested areas, preferring to return to their alpine habitat when the weather has cooled. When snow is heavy, they will paw away snow to reach the vegetation below. Siberian ibexes communicate with each other during the breeding season, when warning about predators, and for recognition between mother and young. Females usually recognize their newborn through scents and also call their young for feeding. Communication during the rut is based mainly on physical posturing in which males perform flehmen. Flehmen includes raising and curling of the upper lip, along with shutting the external nares.",
            "WhatItEats": "Siberian ibexes are herbivores (folivores) and their diet mainly consists of alpine grasses and herbs.

They are widely regarded as among the most dangerous animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates they gore, trample, and kill over 200 people every year. Compared with other large bovids, African buffalo have a long but stocky body and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The adult buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a \"boss\". Savannah-type buffalo have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls often have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are 30-40% smaller, reddish-brown in color, with much more hair growth around the ears and with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats.",
            "Habitat": "African buffalo may be active throughout the day and night. They are social and live in herds which consist of related females, and their offspring, in an almost linear dominance hierarchy. The basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females, and old or invalid animals. The young males keep their distance from the dominant bull, which is recognizable by the thickness of his horns. During the dry season, males leave the herd and form, bachelor groups. Two types of bachelor herds occur: ones made of males aged 4 to 7 years and those of males 12 years or older. During the wet season, the younger bulls rejoin a herd to mate with the females. They stay with them throughout the season to protect the calves. Males have a linear dominance hierarchy based on age and size. Since a buffalo is safer when a herd is larger, dominant bulls may rely on subordinate bulls and sometimes tolerate their copulation. When chased by predators, a herd sticks close together and makes it hard for the predators to pick off one member. Calves are gathered in the middle. A buffalo herd responds to the distress call of a captured member and tries to rescue it. African buffalo make various vocalizations. They emit low-pitched calls to signal the herd to move. To signal to the herd to change direction, leaders emit \"gritty\", \"creaking gate\" sounds. When moving to drinking places, some individuals make long \"maaa\" calls up to 20 times a minute. When being aggressive, they make explosive grunts that may last long or turn into a rumbling growl. Cows produce croaking calls when looking for their calves. Calves make a similar call of a higher pitch when in distress. When threatened by predators, they make drawn-out \"waaaa\" calls. When grazing, they make various sounds, such as brief bellows, grunts, honks, and croaks.",
            "WhatItEats": "African buffalo have a strictly herbivorous (graminivorous, folivorous) diet. They feed on a wide variety of grasses, sedges, leaves, and other plants.",
            "ageRange": "11 to 29 Years",
            "Threats": "The biggest threat to African buffalo is habitat loss due to fragmentation, expansion of settlements and agriculture, and livestock grazing. In the past, numbers of African buffalo suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates. Being a member of the big-five game family, a term originally used to describe the five most dangerous animals to hunt, the African buffalo is a sought-after trophy, with some hunters paying over $10,000 for the opportunity to hunt one. The larger bulls are targeted for their trophy value, although in some areas, buffalo are still hunted for meat.",

            "Species": "Trichechus manatus\r",
            "Description": "When travelling to America, Christopher Columbus mistook this aquatic mammal for a mermaid. The West Indian manatee has a large, round body that tapers to the tail and tough skin, which is colored in grey-brown. The body and muzzle bristles of this animal exhibit sparsely distributed hairs. The forelimbs of the West Indian manatee are short flippers. This animal has a paddle-shaped tail, as opposed to closely related dugong which displays a fluke-like tail. One of the noteworthy facts about this species is the continuous replacement of the molar teeth. Usually, new teeth emerge at the back of the jaw, replacing worn teeth at the front. According to some studies, West Indian manatee has sensory hairs, which are likely to provide the animal with a sixth sense and allow to detect pressure changes.",
            "Habitat": "The West Indian manatees are non-territorial and solitary animals, which may occasionally be observed in loosely organized, temporary concentrations. When gathering into these groups, they usually display no social hierarchy. As nomadic animals, West Indian manatees are constantly on the move, travelling from one place to another to find food. These animals may be active at any time of the day. The West Indian manatees rest for several hours at a time. They may rest both at the water's surface and at the sea floor. Meanwhile, they have to regularly come to the surface for air (every few minutes) when resting on the sea floor. These animals are able to remain underwater for up to 15 minutes, though generally dive for about 4 minutes. The West Indian manatees are very agile and playful animals, known to perform maneuvers such as somersaults, rolls and swimming upside-down. They are normally not vocal animals, but can occasionally vocalize, emitting squeals, chirps, and screams.",
            "WhatItEats": "The West Indian manatee are primarily herbivorous. The diet of this animal generally consists of sea grasses and plant leaves, found on the sea floor.",
            "ageRange": "28 to 60 Years",
            "Threats": "One of the major threats to the population of this species is frequent collisions with boats. Another concern is loss of warm water springs that are the natural habitat of these manatees. The animals are often entangled in fishing gear. In addition, they suffer from red tide blooms. On the other hand, pollutants cause reduction in the amount of seagrass, which is the main food source for the West Indian manatees. And finally, these vulnerable animals have a small population and a very low birth rate, which poses a serious threat to the future of this species.",

            "Description": "The Snow goose, covered in beautiful white feathers, is a large bird. But they aren’t always white and also have the name of blue goose. They are blue when young and become white as they mature. A Snow goose has a round body with very well-defined feathers. They have a long neck and a very small head. Their bill is short and pointed and has a triangle design. Their legs are short and they have webbed feet. Under their wings they have dark brown colors that are only seen in flight.",
            "Habitat": "Their breeding grounds are low grassy tundra which have flat basins, no more than 10 km from a lake, river, flood plain, or sea. They like coastal lagoons, marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats but are also found on prairies and agricultural lands.",
            "WhatItEats": "Snow geese are herbivorous, eating roots, leaves, sedges and grasses. In the breeding grounds in the north the most common source of food is the American bulrush. They can also be found foraging in agricultural fields for leftover corn, oats and winter wheat. They must also take in some sort of grit to help their digestion, sand or shell fragments serving this purpose.",
            "ageRange": "20 Years",
            "Threats": "The main threat to this bird is from hunting, despite restrictions to protect them from over hunting. The Snow goose may itself degrade its own habitat during the early part of the breeding season by grubbing vigorously when seeking food, not only compromising its own breeding success but that of nesting shorebirds. Snow geese will suffer from lead poisoning if they take in fallen lead shot while they are foraging.",

            "Description": "The Sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales, and makes many people think of the \"Moby Dick\" story when they see one. The name of this whale is from the huge bulbous organ containing a liquid wax called spermaceti. This wax can be heated or cooled, possibly by water drawn in through the whale's blowhole, and therefore shrinks and increases its density (assisting the whale to sink), or expands and decreases its density (assisting the whale come up to the surface). The alternative name \"cachalot\" was given by early whalers and is from the Portuguese and Spanish \"cachalote\" from \"cachola\", meaning \"big head\".",
            "Habitat": "Sperm whales are very gregarious and they form groups of around 100 individuals, roughly according to age and gender. More common, however, are loose family groups of about 30 animals. Groups often consist of either \"nursery schools\" of juveniles and adult females, as distinct from groups of bachelor bulls. Older males are typically solitary except in the breeding season. These whales make clicking sounds for echolocation, but also use a range of other sounds such as groans, whistles, chirps, squeaks, pings, yelps, and wheezes. They also make a stereotyped, repetitive series of around 3-40 clicks when they meet another whale, known as a whale's \"coda.\" A Sperm whale is a very deep diver and may remain under water from 20 minutes to more than an hour. On surfacing, they usually blow 20 to 70 times before diving again.",
            "WhatItEats": "The Sperm whale feeds primarily on squid (particularly giant squid), octopi and deepwater fish, and also sharks and skates.",
            "ageRange": "70 Years",
            "Threats": "Sperm whales suffer from commercial harpoon fisheries in Indonesia, the Lesser Antilles, and Japan. Selective hunting of the biggest breeding males will probably have decreased rates of reproduction, and loss of the largest female whales from nursery groups will have decreased the groups' survival. Further threats include becoming tangled in fishing gear, collisions with boats, underwater and anthropogenic noise, an increasing concern as regards the habitat of whales, particularly for deep-diving sperm whales that make use of sound when feeding, communicating, and navigating in the ocean.",

They have striking orange to reddish-brown fur, with black legs and a tufted white stripe along the spine. Adults have white markings around the eyes and on the cheeks and jaws; the rest of the muzzle and face are a contrasting black. The fur on the jaw and the flanks is longer than that on the body, with the males having especially prominent facial whiskers. The entire body of Red river hogs is covered with hair, with no bare skin visible. Males are slightly larger than females and have conical protuberances on either side of the snout and small, sharp tusks. These facial protuberances are bony and probably protect the male's face during head-to-head combat with other males.",
            "Habitat": "Red river hogs are primarily nocturnal and spend most of the time searching for food. They use their large muzzle to snuffle about in the soil in search of food, as well as scraping the ground with their tusks and fore-feet. They also often follow chimpanzees in search of dropped fruit. Red river hogs live in small groups that consist of six to ten animals, composed of a single adult male, and a number of adult females and their young. However, much larger groups, with over 30 individuals can also occur, especially in favorable habitats. Red river hogs are territorial and males defend their harem aggressively against predators. The favorite activity of these animals is wallowing in muddy ponds and streams. They are also good swimmers and fast runners. Red river hogs communicate almost continuously with grunts and squeals with a repertoire that can signal alarm, distress, or passive contact.",
            "WhatItEats": "Red river hogs are omnivorous, feeding mainly on roots and tubers. They supplement their diet with fruit, grasses, herbs, eggs, dead animal and plant remains, insects, and lizards.",
            "ageRange": "15 to 20 Years",
            "Threats": "The biggest threat to Red river hogs is hunting as these animals are one of the primary prey species harvested for commercial purposes within the bushmeat trade in most of Central Africa. In some countries, Red river hogs cause damage to agricultural crops, and for this reason, they are persecuted by farmers. Another threat to these animals is the loss of their habitat, which also leads to overhunting.",

Females stay in their natal groups and males leave after sexual maturity. These macaques are hierarchical and establish the rank in hierarchy through biting and slapping. However, they are not agressive and are peaceful creatures. Stump-tailed macaques communicate visually and vocally. Common visual signs are \"teeth chattering\", \"lip smacking\" and \"barred teeth\". Vocal sounds include the \"coo\" sound to stay in contact with others, grunts and alpha males \"roar\" to chase off predators.",

Goiter gazelles get their name from the goiter-like enlargement on the throat of the males during the mating season. Another meaning of their name is \"full below the throat\". Males in this species are larger than females and have larger goiters. In general, females are hornless.",
            "Habitat": "Goitered gazelles are social animals. During summertime, they live in small family groups consisting of 2-9 individuals. However, in winter, they gather in larger herds and migrate to valleys where the cold and winds are not so strong. During this time herds cover up to 10-30 km per day. Goitered gazelles are diurnal creatures. In summer they prefer to feed in the early morning and in the afternoon. In order to cool themselves during the heat of the day, they dig and lay in shallow pits. During cold periods of time, they may forage continuously and rest briefly at midday. In areas where these gazelles can be hunted, they can become nocturnal. When Goitered gazelles feel threatened, they make a series of stiff-legged jumps. When they run at high speeds, they gallop holding their necks outstretched and tails upright. In order to communicate with each other, Goitered gazelles use deep grunts, hissing, moos and wheezing. Females make hoarse, low-pitched sounds to call their young and calves to respond to them with a low-pitched “moo”.

These units are generally harems, consisting of a single mature male as well as a few mature females with their offspring. By the early mating season (July-October), some groups have additinal mature males, which are the newly matured offspring. They are driven out of the group, joining bachelor herds. In the beginning of winter, males exhibit highly territorial behavior, patrolling the home ranges of their herds and marking it with urine, dung or scent glands, located under their eyes. These animals show increased activity during the nighttime hours, when they come out of their shelters to graze in open valleys. Daytime hours, on the other hand, are typically spent in brushy habitats. Some populations of this species lead sedentary lifestyle, remaining in the same area throughout the year. Others display nomadic behavior, constantly being on the move. Meanwhile, there are populations that migrate to other regions.",

            "name": "Giant forest hog",
            "Species": "Hylochoerus meinertzhageni\r",
            "Description": "Giant forest hogs are considered the largest wild member of the pig family. They have extensive hairs on their body, which become less pronounced with age. They are mostly black in color on the surface, though hairs nearest the skin are a deep orange color. The ears are large and pointy, and the tusks of a male may reach a length of 36 centimeters. Females in this species are generally smaller than males.",
            "Habitat": "Giant forest hogs live in herds (sounders) of up to 20 animals consisting of females and their offspring, but usually also including a single old male. They are usually nocturnal, but in cold periods, they are more commonly seen during daylight hours. They may also be diurnal in regions where protected from humans. In safe areas, where Giant forest hogs are not hunted, they stay active for many hours and may travel up to 8-12 km per day. They will feed in the open, travel between pastures, sleeping areas, water holes, wallows and rubbing places, latrines, and mineral licks which are connected by paths through the underbrush. When threatened by their main predators such as hyena and leopard, piglets freeze at the sound of an alarm grunt and adults will surround them in order to defend.",
            "WhatItEats": "Giant forest hogs are mainly herbivores, but also scavenge. They feed on grasses, leaves, sedges, and herbage.",
            "ageRange": "5 to 18 Years",
            "Threats": "Giant forest hogs are threatened by the deforestation of their habitat and buy hunting for food. These and other and other forms of human disturbance have led to the local decrease or even extinction of populations. Diseases and parasites transmission may also pose a big threat to this species.",

            "name": "Bobolink",
            "Species": "Dolichonyx oryzivorus",
            "Description": "Fluttering over hayfields and meadows in summer, the male of this species produces a bubbling, tinkling song, after which it is named. The male is easily distinguished in its spring finery and is the only North American bird with a white back and black undersides (which could be described as wearing a tuxedo backwards). Before the fall migration he molts and takes on a striped brown appearance similar to the female. bobolinks with this plumage were once called \"ricebirds\" in the south, occasionally causing serious damage in this area in the rice fields.",
            "Habitat": "These birds spend their winter within a more limited range, from south-west Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, north-east Argentina to the province of Buenos Aires. They breed in semi-open and open grassy areas. In winter and during migration they are found in grasslands, freshwater marshes, and rice fields.",
            "WhatItEats": "This species is omnivore (insectivore and granivore), it mainly eats seeds (such as rice and weed seeds), insects and spiders.",
            "ageRange": "4-9 years",
            "Threats": "Habitat loss is the greatest threat to these birds. Changes in land use in North America are causing the decline of the hayfields and meadows where bobolinks breed, and in South America, agricultural land is replacing grasslands that support birds when overwintering. In the southern U.S., bobolinks are shot as agricultural pests, and they are also persecuted for this reason in South America in their wintering grounds. In Jamaica they are used for food, and in Argentina males are trapped to be sold as cage birds.",

            "name": "Red-fronted lemur",
            "Species": "Eulemur rufifrons\r",
            "Description": "The Red-fronted lemur is a medium-sized species with a defined sexual dimorphism. Both males and females are the same size and display considerably long tails, but differ in their color pattern. Thus, males have a grey to grey-brown fur and a bushy reddish-brown head crown. Meanwhile, females are distinguished by a reddish-brown with a dark head crown. Individuals of both genders exhibit paler under-parts, white markings above each eye, a black muzzle. Most individuals have a dark streak, running from their muzzle up to the crown. Newborn babies of both sexes display male color pattern until 3 - 4 months old. The Red-fronted lemur hasn't been recognized as separate species for a long period of time. The name of this animal was used as a secondary name for the red-fronted brown lemur that, in turn, was commonly thought to be a subspecies of the Brown lemur.",
            "Habitat": "The Red-fronted lemurs are highly social animals, forming groups of 5 - 18 individuals, consisting of both mature males and females. Each group may occupy a large territory of more than 100 hectares. Between 3 and 4.5 years old, males tend to move between groups. It may take from 6 to 12 months for them to find a new group. However, when joining a group, they typically remain with it until old age. Additionally, females in western populations are known to often leave their natal groups after reaching maturity at 23 - 26 months old. Red-fronted lemurs are cathemeral creatures that are active during both day and night. Meanwhile, they have irregular periods of activity throughout the 24-hour day. Red-fronted lemurs are tree-dwelling animals, generally spending their time in the upper canopy. When travelling among trees, they move around on all of their four legs. When travelling, these lemurs communicate with each other through a wide variety of vocalizations.",
            "WhatItEats": "These animals are generally frugivores, as more than a half of their diet consists of various fruits, while the other half is typically composed of leaves, flowers, insects and arthropods.",
            "ageRange": "20 to 25 Years",
            "Threats": "The biggest threat to the population of this species as a whole is loss of their natural habitat due to a number of factors such as logging, clearance for pastures and fuelwood as well as the activity known as ‘tavy’ - this is when vegetation of a certain area is cut and burnt to create arable land. On the other hand, population in the southeastern part of the island faces about 1.5% destruction of their rainforest habitat. If this continues, the whole rainforest will disappear by 2020. Additionally, Red-fronted lemurs are commonly hunted and trapped.",
